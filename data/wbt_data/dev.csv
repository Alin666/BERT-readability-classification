2,4,"Heat can be transferred from place to place by The transfer of heat energy through a material - without the material itself moving. The transfer of heat energy through a moving liquid or gas. Electromagnetic radiation emitted from a hot object. . Dark matt surfaces are better at absorbing heat energy than light shiny surfaces. Heat energy can be lost from homes in many different ways and there are ways of reducing these heat losses. There are several different types of energy, and these can be transferred from one type to another. Energy transfer diagrams show the energy transfers in a process. More efficient devices transfer the energy supplied to them into a greater proportion of useful energy than less efficient devices do. Heat is thermal energy. It can be transferred from one place to another by conduction, convection and radiation. Conduction and convection involve particles, but radiation involves electromagnetic waves. Thermogram of a pan being heated on a stove Heat energy can move through a substance by conduction. , but non-metals and gases are usually poor conductors of heat. Poor conductors of heat are called insulators. Heat energy is conducted from the hot end of an object to the cold end. The electrons in piece of metal can leave their atoms and move about in the metal as free electrons. The parts of the metal atoms left behind are now charged metal ions. The ions are packed closely together and they vibrate continually. The hotter the metal, the more kinetic energy these vibrations have. This kinetic energy is transferred from hot parts of the metal to cooler parts by the free electrons. These move through the structure of the metal, colliding with ions as they go. Liquids and gases are fluids. The particles in these fluids can move from place to place. Convection occurs when particles with a lot of heat energy in a liquid or gas move and take the place of particles with less heat energy. Heat energy is transferred from hot places to cooler places by convection. Liquids and gases expand when they are heated . This is because the particles in liquids and gases move faster when they are heated than they do when they are cold. As a result, the particles take up more volume. This is because the gap between particles widens, while the particles themselves stay the same size. The liquid or gas in hot areas is less dense than the liquid or gas in cold areas, so it rises into the cold areas. The denser cold liquid or gas falls into the warm areas. In this way, that transfer heat from place to place are set up. Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

8,2,"Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a group of tiny people inhabited caves on a remote tropical island in Indonesia. That is a country that lies between Asia and Australia. The little people made stone tools to spear giant rats and hunted large lizards and tiny elephants in packs. Believe it or not, this is no fairy tale. Inside a cave on the Indonesian island of Flores, scientists discovered the bones of seven people who belonged to a new , or type, of human. The most intact skeleton was that of a child-sized adult female. ""If you told me an alien spacecraft had landed on Flores, I would have been less surprised than by this discovery,"" said Peter Brown, one of the scientists behind the rare find. The miniature humans had bulging eyes and brains that were no bigger than those of newborn babies. Standing barely 3 feet tall, an adult was about the size of a 3-year-old child today. Their tiny size earned them the nickname ""hobbits."" That name comes from the dwarflike creatures that appear in books by What is even more amazing about the scientists' discovery is that the small humans lived as recently as 13,000 years ago. That may seem very long ago to you, but modern humans existed at the same time. Did the newly discovered hobbits and modern humans live on Flores together? Scientists estimate that modern humans reached the island more than 35,000 years ago. Whether the two groups interacted remains a mystery, but scientists hope the discovery will teach them more about the history of humans. measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.

Experts know that the Egyptians didn't have the same tools that we have today. So, how were those heavy blocks moved and lifted? Some experts believe that the Egyptians pushed and pulled them into place. 1. Workers cut and shaped the stone into blocks. 2. The workers floated the blocks down the Nile River on big barges. 3. The workers rolled the blocks over logs from the river to the pyramid. 4. The workers built dirt ramps so the blocks could be rolled to the top of the pyramid. 5. Workers carefully fit the stone blocks into place on the pyramid. No one knows for sure what the dinosaurs looked like. Some experts think that dinosaur skin might have looked and felt like the scaly skin of reptiles today. Experts study how animals today use skin color to survive.

14,4,"Account for the emergence of NICRA in 1967? Teacher's notes: This question is worth 6 marks in the exam. Give yourself 7 - 8 minutes to answer it. Mark Scheme: In History you are marked by levels. The higher the level the more marks you get and so the higher grade you will achieve. The answer will provide few reasons for the emergence of NICRA with no real explanations offered. The answer will provide more reasons with some explanations offered. The answer will provide a number of reasons with detailed explanations. NICRA was set up because of events in the USA where Martin Luther King Jr. was leading a similar campaign in America in the 1960s. At the same time discrimination in Northern Ireland was still continuing. NICRA campaigned for ""One Man, One Vote"". John would get a level 1 for this answer. The candidate only touches on the influence of the USA and events in Northern Ireland. The candidate does not develop the two points to answer the question fully and directly. NICRA emerged due to a number of events and influences. A major factor in its emergence was the impact of the 1947 Education Act. This made Catholics more confident in the 1960s to demand civil rights. A further influence was the establishment of the Campaign for Social Justice in 1964. This organisation highlighted the forms of discrimination that existed in Northern Ireland by the mid 1960s. This helped bring about the establishment of NICRA in 1967. A final factor to explain the emergence of NICRA was Labour's victory in the 1964 General Election. Paul would get a level 2 for this answer. The candidate makes two valid points in the first paragraph. However other important factors are omitted and he does not explain the last point in the second paragraph. The emergence of NICRA can be explained by a number of events, both within Northern Ireland and outside of Northern Ireland. The 1947 Education Act helped to create a larger professional and educated Catholic class in Northern Ireland. It was more assertive and confident in demanding civil rights for all by the mid 1960s. Also within Northern Ireland there was the Campaign for Social Justice that was set up in 1964. This organisation acted as a forerunner for the emergence of NICRA in 1967. Furthermore within Northern Ireland by the mid 1960s, members of a number of political parties, as well as labour and republican groups were working to establish a civil rights movement. They felt that O'Neill's government had done little to address grievances in voting, housing, policing and employment. Outside of Northern Ireland there were other influences. The 1960s witnessed the emergence of a civil rights movement in the USA. It was having some success and this inspired a similar movement in Northern Ireland. Also in 1964 a Labour government was elected in Britain. Labour was seen as being more sympathetic to the nationalist cause. This may have raised the expectations of Catholics into believing that a protest group campaigning for civil rights might succeed. A year later over 100 MPs in Britain formed the Campaign for Democracy in Ulster. This further raised the expectations of Catholics and influenced the establishment of NICRA. Michael would get a level 3 for this answer. This response is very direct and extremely comprehensive. The candidate is aware of all the important factors that account for the emergence of NICRA.

17,4,"Islam: beliefs about care of the planet The relationship between human beings and the earth is increasingly complicated and urgent. Every day there are stories about pollution, global warming and animal species facing extinction. Religion is responding with views on the enviroment and our responsibility for it. Although human beings are seen as the most intelligent life form on earth, they are responsible for almost all the done to the planet. If we imagined the earth is aged 46, all the damage done has taken place in the last 60 seconds of the earth's life. That which is read or recited. The Divine Book revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. Allah's final revelation to humankind. of the world. Human beings are on the world as trustees or ‘vice-regents’ - they are told to look after the world for Allah and for the future: The Earth is green and beautiful, and Allah has appointed you his stewards over it. The whole earth has been created a place of worship, pure and clean. Whoever plants a tree and diligently looks after it until it matures and bears fruit is rewarded. If a Muslim plants a tree or sows a field and humans and beasts and birds eat from it, all of it is , Muslims are instructed to look after the environment and not to damage it: Devote thyself single-mindedly to the Faith, and thus follow the nature designed by Allah, the nature according to which He has fashioned mankind. There is no altering the creation of Allah. Muslims have to look after the earth because it is all Allah’s creation and it is part of a human’s duty to Allah: Allah is He Who raised up the heavens without any pillars that you can see. Then He settled Himself on the Throne, and constrained the sun and the moon to serve you; each planet pursues its course during an appointed term. He regulates it all and expounds the Signs, that you may have firm belief in the meeting with your Lord. He it is Who spread out the earth and made therein firmly fixed mountains and rivers, and of fruits of every kind He has made pairs. He causes the night to cover the day. In all this, verily, are signs doer a people who reflect. Because of this passage, people see themselves as being for the world which Allah created and they have to make their own decisions about how to do this. In 1986, HRH Prince Philip, then President of the WWF International invited five leaders of five of the major religions of the world - - to meet to discuss how their faiths could help The meeting took place in Assisi in Italy, because it was the birth place of St Francis, the Catholic saint of ecology. From this meeting arose key statements by the five faiths outlining their own distinctive traditions and approach to the care for nature. In the Assisi Declarations on Nature the Muslim statement was: The Islamic name for God in the Arabic language is Unity; and His Unity is also reflected in the unity of mankind, and the unity of man and nature. His trustees are responsible for maintaining the unity of His creation, the integrity of the Earth, its flora and fauna, its wildlife and natural environment. Unity cannot be had by discord, by setting one need against another or letting one end predominate over another; it is maintained by balance and harmony. There Muslims say that Islam is the middle path and we will be answerable for how we have walked this path, how we have maintained balance and harmony in the whole of creation around us. So unity, trusteeship and accountability, that is Tawhid, Everlasting life after death - the afterlife. , the three central concepts of Islam, are also the pillars of the environmental ethics of Islam. They constitute the basic values taught by the That which is read or recited. The Divine Book revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. Allah's final revelation to humankind. . It is these values which led , the Prophet of Islam, to say: ‘Whoever plants a tree and diligently looks after it until it matures and bears fruit is rewarded.' For all these reasons Muslims see themselves as having a responsibility towards the world and the environment, all of which are the creations of Allah. Unlike many other religions, Muslims do not have any specific festivals in which they give thanks for the harvest or the world. Instead they give thanks to Allah regularly for his creation. In order to separate Islam from other religions, the Islamic year is only 354 days, this means that the months and festivals happen at a different time each year and so there is no particular festival which falls during a period of harvest.

18,2,"Some people consider the toothbrush one of the most important inventions. Today, we take brushing and flossing for granted, but can you imagine what your life would be like without a toothbrush? Anyone who's ever had a toothache will tell you that it can be very painful. Since ancient times, humans have tried different ways to stop the rot. Here are a few: Ancient Egyptians placed a live mouse on a person's gums to relieve a toothache. They believed mice could cure toothaches because the rodents have good teeth. One ancient Roman author wrote that tying a frog to a person's jaw would make teeth stronger. Ancient Romans believed that boiling earthworms in olive oil and then using the oil as eardrops would relieve a toothache. Scientists recently found evidence of what could be Europe's oldest toothbrush. They unearthed the 250-year-old artifact in Germany. An is an object made by a person.Although the bristles had rotted away, the toothbrush's 4-inch-long handle, made from animal bone, was intact. The other end of the brush was carved into a tiny spoon. Scientists think the ancient tool served double duty. They believe that people used the tiny spoon to clean their ears! The bristles were probably hog hairs. Although the toothbrush has been around for several hundred years, people have been caring for their teeth since ancient times. In fact, some scientists say that ancient Egyptians used stalks of grass to clean their teeth. They also believe that people long ago used tooth powders made of charcoal to clean their teeth.

However, many of our students keep their phone on during the day which can disturb lessons. A number of phone thefts have also occurred recently, both in and out of school. I would like to call a meeting to discuss this issue with staff, parents and students. I don't want to ban them, but we must agree on how they can be used sensibly and safely. Write a speech to be given at this meeting analysing the advantages and disadvantages of allowing mobiles in school and suggest how they can be used sensibly and safely. 2.

Women were recruited into the armed forces as nurses, drivers, cooks and telephonists. The Defence of the Realm Act (DORA) - this was passed in August 1914. DORA allowed the government to take over the coal mines, railways and shipping. Lloyd George became Minister of Munitions and set up state-run factories. The government worked with the trade unions to prevent strikes. - there were fewer workers because so many men left to join the army. - a fixed allowance for sugar, meat, butter, jam and tea was introduced in 1918. British Summer Time was also introduced to give more daylight working hours. - newspaper and soldiers' letters were censored.

This is released into the air through the car exhaust system. Nitrogen monoxide then reacts with more oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide. is a poisonous gas. It dissolves in rain water to form acid rain and contributes to the formation of smog. In city streets it can build up to concentrations that may be harmful to the lungs. But recent studies suggest that the danger from nitrogen dioxide could also be in our homes. The World Health Organisation recommends an hourly limit of 200 micrograms of nitrogen dioxide in each cubic metre of air. In a survey scientists found that many homes that use gas for cooking sometimes have concentrations above this limit. The table shows a comparison between nitrogen dioxide concentrations in samples of air from one kitchen when a gas cooker was in use, and from a city street.

32,4,"Abortion is the artificial ending of the life of a foetus in the womb (uterus). A natural abortion is called a miscarriage. Abortion has been legal in England, Scotland and Wales since 1967 when The Abortion Act was passed. A new upper time limit of 24 weeks was introduced in 1990 under The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act. An abortion may be carried out if one of the following conditions applies: the life or physical health of the mother is at risk the mental health of the mother is at risk there is a reasonable chance that the child will be born seriously disabled Where the mental health of the mother is at risk, or her family will suffer if the pregnancy continues, the latest termination date is 24 weeks. There is no upper limit if the life or physical health of the mother is at risk, or if there is a reasonable chance of a seriously disabled child being born. In 1974 119,000 legal abortions were carried out in England and Wales, by 2006 this figure had risen to 193,700. The Christian Church teaches that life is a sacred gift from God: Then God said, ‘Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.’ So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. Christian teaching on abortion is complex. An early Christian document, the Didache, condemns it: You shall not kill by abortion the fruit of the womb. The Bible appears to say that life begins when the baby is in the mother’s womb: For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb. Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart. opposes abortion in every instance. However, if life saving treatment given to a pregnant woman results in the unavoidable loss of a foetus, but saves the mother, then this is accepted and known as 'double effect'. Roman Catholic teaching is that the foetus is a human being. This is clearly expressed in the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) which states: From the first moment of his(her) existence, a human being must be recognised as having the rights of a person – among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. (Quakers) believe that although abortion should not be encouraged, the life of the unborn child cannot be seen as more important than that of the mother. movement generally argues that life becomes human life at the point of conception. It says that abortion should not be allowed, but most would allow an abortion if the mother’s life was at risk or if pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. movement generally argues that human life begins much later in pregnancy, or at birth. There are many points of view among pro-choicers, but fundamentally they think that the woman should have full control over what happens to her body. Post ideas and discuss Religious Studies here.

33,3,"Food chains - Changes to food webs Food chains - Changes to food webs Let's look at the food web again and ask some questions about its predator-prey relationships, with some possible answers. What would happen if the grass died? The grass is the producer, so if it died the consumers that feed on it - rabbits, insects and slugs - would have no food. They would starve and die unless they could move to another habitat. All the other animals in the food web would die too, because their food supplies would have died out. The populations of the consumers would fall as the population of the producer fell. What would happen if the population of slugs decreased? Slugs, rabbits and insects all eat grass. If there were fewer slugs there would be more grass for the rabbits and insects. With more food the populations of rabbits and insects would increase. However, the thrushes would have to eat more insects to maintain their population, so it is also possible that the population of insects could decrease. This is turn may reduce the populations of voles and frogs. What would happen if the population of insects decreased? There would be more food for the rabbits and slugs, so their populations would increase. However, there would be less food for the frogs and voles, so their populations would decrease. This means less food for the foxes and hawks. However, there are likely to be more rabbits and thrushes for them to eat, so their populations are likely to stay the same. Hungry for knowledge?

On March 6, a 6.3-magnitude quake destroyed dozens of buildings, killed at least 70 people, and injured hundreds of others. It was followed by several or smaller earthquakes. The quakes sent people running from their homes in search of safety. ""We all just fled as quickly as we could,"" an Indonesian worker told reporters. The worker was in the seaside town of Padang when the ground began to move. Padang is just a few miles southwest of the of the earthquake. The epicenter is the area above the underground point where the earthquake begins. Many people living near the ocean ran for higher ground during the tremors. They feared that the earthquake would trigger giant waves similar to the devastating tsunami that hit southern Asia and eastern Africa in 2004. That disaster was caused by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake in the Indian Ocean off Sumatra. Fortunately, the March earthquake was not powerful enough to cause a similar disaster. The earthquake was strong enough to topple buildings inland. The town of Solok suffered the most damage. Hospitals there ran out of beds for injured people. Cots were set up for patients being treated for cuts and broken bones.

35,3,"Food chains - Getting carbon dioxide, light and water Food chains - Getting carbon dioxide, light and water Remember that the equation for photosynthesis is: carbon dioxide + water (+ light energy) Let's see how plants get the carbon dioxide and water they need for this process. Plants get carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves. The carbon dioxide through small holes in the underside of the leaf called stomata. (One of these holes is called a stoma. The plural is stomata.) The lower part of the leaf has loose-fitting cells, to allow carbon dioxide to reach the other cells in the leaf. This also allow the oxygen produced in photosynthesis to leave the leaf easily. A leaf usually has a large surface area, so that it can absorb a lot of light. Its top surface is protected from water loss, disease and weather damage by a waxy layer. The upper part of the leaf is where the light falls, and it contains a type of cell called a . This is adapted to absorb a lot of light. It has lots of chloroplasts and is shaped like a tall box. Turgid plant that's watered regularly and a flacid plant without enough water. Plants get the water they need for photosynthesis through their roots. The roots have a type of cell called a root hair cell - these project out from the root into the soil. Roots have a big surface area and thin walls, which allow water to pass into them easily. Note that root cells do not contain chloroplasts, as they are normally in the dark and cannot photosynthesise. The water absorbed by the root hair cells passes through the plant in tubes, and eventually reachers the leaves. If a plant does not absorb enough water, it will wilt or go floppy. Without water it may also not photosynthesise quickly enough, and it may die. Hungry for knowledge? Prey on this activity. Whack and zap mad professors and aliens!

The poll found that at least 65 percent of Florida's voters favor new steps that would help protect the endangered manatees. Some of those steps include lowering the speed limit for boats in manatee zones, increasing fines for people who speed in manatee zones, limiting the amount of building along waterways where manatees are found, and creating additional protected areas for manatees. ""We are struck by [how far] Florida voters are willing to go to protect manatees,"" said Kate Stewart, who conducted the poll. She said the results also showed that ""boaters and non-boaters alike not just support but strongly support increased protection measures."" Florida manatees live in the state's warm coastal and inland waters. The Save the Manatee Club says that the Florida manatee population has been shrinking since 1974, when scientists started keeping track. Collisions with boats cause many manatee deaths. Since manatees swim slowly, they cannot get out of the way of a fast-moving boat. According to the Save the Manatee Club, 78 manatees were killed in collisions with boats in Florida waters last year. So far this year, at least 23 manatees have been killed in collisions. All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation. "
38,4,"Food chains, pyramids of numbers and pyramids of biomass are all ways of showing how energy is passed on from one organism to another. Biomass is the food available for the next trophic level (feeding level) in a food chain. Biomass is used as a source of renewable energy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Here is an example of a food chain. Grass is eaten by voles that are eaten by owls. A food chain shows how energy is from one organism to another. The original source of energy is the Sun, which in this example provides the in this food chain. The vole and the owl are of organisms in a food chain can be represented graphically in a . Each bar represents the number of individuals at each trophic level (feeding level) in the food chain. In this example a large number of caterpillars living in a single oak tree provide food for several blue tits, which in turn are consumed by a sparrowhawk. The pyramid of numbers usually shows that the number of organisms at each trophic level gets smaller towards the top. This particular case is an exception – one tree provides food for many caterpillars. of plants to provide sufficient energy for the is a more accurate indication of how much is passed on at each trophic level. in each organism multiplied by the total number of organisms in that trophic level. This makes it easier to compare the food value of a small number of large organisms with a large number of small organisms. Pyramids of biomass usually are a true pyramid shape (each level is smaller than the one below it). The biomass in each trophic level is always less than the trophic level below. This is because biomass is a measure of the amount of food available. When animals eat, only a small proportion of their food is converted into new tissue, which is the food for the next trophic level. Most of the biomass that animals eat is either not digested, or used to provide the energy needed for staying alive. This table shows that for each 100kJ of energy consumed by a cow, 63kJ is not absorbed into the cow and only 4kJ is converted into new tissue. How much energy is used in respiration and given out as heat? Total energy 100kJ = 4kJ + 63kJ + energy used in respiration. So energy used in respiration = 100 - 67 = How efficient is energy transfer to the next level of the food chain? The cow is 4% efficient at converting its food into food for the next trophic level. Efficiency of energy transfer = (energy transferred to next level x 100) / energy from previous level Efficiency of energy transfer = (4kJ x 100) / 100kJ energy converter it could be given food that's easier to digest, to reduce the energy lost by egestion. It could also be kept in conditions where it doesn't need to use as much energy in respiration – it could be kept warm, and prevented from moving around. These ideas are used in intensive farming techniques. the amount of energy available to the next trophic level by about 90%. This means that the top trophic levels receive very little energy unless they live in very fertile habitats. For this reason there's a limit to the number of trophic levels in a food chain. Try the next animation to see how much energy is available to the top trophic level. Work out the efficiency of energy transfer at each trophic level. Note the units of energy used are kilocalories. One kilocalorie is equivalent to 4.2 kilojoules. The units should not affect your efficiency calculation. Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

It can also be used as a source of , to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, and to help reduce air pollution. Using biomass as fuel still puts carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere, but it's the same carbon dioxide taken from the air as the biomass was produced. The use of biomass for energy production is Bacteria break down sewage in a digester The methane in biogas can be used as a fuel for heating homes Yeast breaks down the sugar in sugar cane to produce alcohol Bioethanol is used in Brazil to fuel cars Trees such as willow can be burned in power stations Electricity is generated using renewable biomass instead of fossil fuels "
39,2,"While surfing, Matt Kraskiewicz, age 17, felt something tug on his leg. ""It was like someone dropped a weight on my foot,"" he said. That weight was a shark taking a bite out of Matt's leg. Eleven-year-old Taylor Holley was standing in waist-deep water when a shark suddenly bit his leg, leaving a 2-inch gash. Should humans be afraid of sharks, or should sharks be afraid of humans? Debate this issue. The above incidents took place in Florida during October. After reading such stories, many people might think that they should not swim in Florida's waters. But shark experts say that would be an overreaction. As scary as they are, shark attacks are rare. The International Shark Attack File (ISAF) says you are more likely to be hit by lightning than be bitten by one of the more than 350 shark species. In fact, each year about 500 people are hurt by lightning in the United States. In 1999, only 58 shark attacks occurred Scientists say some species of sharks can live up to 50 years. The largest shark, the whale shark, can be 50 feet long. Shark skeletons have no bones. The skeleton is made of a tough substance called Not all sharks are meat eaters. Basking sharks, for example, eat , tiny plants and animals that float in water. As a result, basking sharks don't have teeth. Shark Expert Rodney Fox explained, ""Sharks do not like humans; we are too bony. A lot of people who have been bitten by sharks have survived because the shark spat them out."" One reason that shark attacks may seem more common than before is that more people are using shorelines for recreation, said George Burgess of ISAF. Sharks that do bite humans have often mistaken people for other kinds of animals. For example, ISAF officials say sharks attack surfers wearing dark-colored wetsuits more often than they do anyone else. To a shark, the wetsuits make surfers look like seals, a favorite food. Some shark experts say sharks should fear people, not the other way around. One of the biggest threats to sharks, said Burgess, is . Finning happens when a fisher catches a shark, cuts off its fins, and tosses the dead fish overboard. The fins are used to make delicacies such as shark fin soup. Conservation groups are urging governments to protect sharks. During the summer, the U.S. House of Representatives acted to protect sharks when it passed a bill that could prevent finning in U.S. waters. In order for that bill to become law, the U.S. Senate has to pass it, and the president must sign it. U.S. Rep. Randy Cunningham introduced the bill. ""We must end the harmful and wasteful practice of shark finning,"" Cunningham said. measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.

40,2,"Eleven-year-old Josh Cook from Ohio became hooked on pocket bike racing last year. Josh races his pocket bike, or mini motorcycle, on a private track. He also makes sure to wear protective gear and safety equipment, such as a helmet and heavy boots, whenever he rides. Pocket bikes, also called pocket rockets, have found their way onto city streets. Pocket bikes are the most recent craze sweeping the country. Yet this pint-size fun is causing big trouble. Police in cities from Los Angeles to Boston are concerned about the safety of kids riding the popular pocket bikes. At less than 2 feet tall, the mini motorcycles are low to the ground. ""The minibikes are extremely dangerous,"" Los Angeles police officer Ron Fisher told . ""They are so low to the ground that it makes the rider invisible from a driver’s viewpoint."" The mini motorcycles, which are powered by lawn mower engines, are also noisy. They typically reach speeds between 25 and 40 miles an hour. That is about the same speed a car travels on local streets. Although it is legal to buy the bikes, it is against the law to ride them on public streets in many states. Police have been giving tickets to illegal riders. In some cases, officers This has some kids and parents upset. They argue that the companies selling the mini motorcycles don’t inform buyers that they can’t be ridden on public streets. Fisher says the majority of pocket bike riders on the street are 9 and 10 years old. Officials in some states are working to pass laws to limit who can ride the bikes. The officials say that kids should have to wait until they have a driver’s license. Pocket bike racing has been a popular sport in Europe. It has caught on in some communities in the United States during the past few years. Josh and other pocket bike racers agree that the mini motorcycles are not meant to be ridden on city streets. He told us that if people are interested in riding pocket bikes, they should find ""an organized race track."" Do you think kids should be allowed to ride pocket bikes on public streets?

Molten (liquid) rock forms when rocks melt. The molten rock is called . When the magma cools and solidifies, a type of rock called igneous rock forms. Igneous rocks contain randomly arranged interlocking crystals. The size of the crystals depends on how quickly the molten magma solidified. The more You may have done an experiment at school with a substance called salol. If molten salol cools slowly, you get big crystals. If it cools quickly, you get small crystals. If the magma cools quickly, small crystals form in the rock. This can happen if the magma erupts from a volcano. Obsidian and basalt are examples of this type of rock. They are called igneous rocks because they form from eruptions of magma. If the magma cools slowly, large crystals form in the rock. This can happen if the magma cools deep underground. Granite and gabbro are examples of this type of rock. They are igneous rocks because they form from magma underground. Unlike sedimentary rocks, igneous rocks do not contain any fossils. This is because any fossils in the original rock will have melted when the magma formed. More from The environment, the Earth and the universe Join Questionaut's quest to find his friend's hat.

43,2,"A NASA Spacecraft Lands on an Asteroid for the First Time. On February 12, scientists on Earth fired rockets on the spacecraft, turning it toward Eros. Eros is an , or space rock that is orbiting the sun. As the spacecraft slowly descended, it bounced and scientists were afraid the craft would crash. Shown is the location of the asteroid belt in our solar system, and the orbit of Eros. : The planets and their orbits are not drawn to scale. began its incredible space odyssey five years ago. NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) launched the spacecraft in 1996. For the next four years, sped toward Eros, covering nearly 2 billion miles. After studying a few other space objects, the spacecraft settled into orbit around Eros on February 14, 2000. During the following year, the craft took more than 160,000 photos of the potato-shaped asteroid. completed its mission orbiting Eros, NASA scientists decided to try to land the car-sized spacecraft on the asteroid. If the craft succeeded, would become the first craft to land on an asteroid. Scientists knew that the odds were against a safe landing, but they thought it was worth trying. ""Chances [were] less than 1 percent for [ ] to land intact,"" said scientist Helen Worth. NASA scientists on Earth guided the spacecraft toward the surface of Eros by remote control. Descending at 4 miles per hour, the spacecraft landed after bouncing once. Thinking that the spacecraft had crashed, scientists were surprised to learn that it was sending information from the asteroid's surface. ""It's working, and we are getting good information,"" said NASA scientist Jacob Trombka shortly after the landing. As a result of the successful landing, NASA continued the mission for an additional ten days. Scientists already know that most asteroids orbit the sun between Mars and Jupiter in an area called the . Eros, however, is a kind of asteroid that comes closer to Earth than most asteroids. Such asteroids are called . Scientists believe that Eros may be similar to the near-Earth asteroid that slammed into Earth 65 million years ago, probably killing the dinosaurs. About 350 near-Earth asteroids have been found. Scientists carefully map the orbits of those asteroids. They say those asteroids will not hit Earth anytime soon. However, one might hit someday, scientists say. There may be another 1,000 near-Earth asteroids scientists haven't discovered. Scientists worry that one of the unknown asteroids might threaten Earth. Scientists will use the information they gathered from Eros to protect Earth from asteroids that come too close to the third rock from the sun. Eros is about twice the length of Manhattan, New York. Eros orbits the sun once every 21 months. Eros has so little gravity that a baseball hit on its surface would fly into space. A person weighing 200 pounds on Earth would weigh 2 ounces on Eros. The daytime temperature on Eros is about 212 degrees Fahrenheit. The nighttime temperature on Eros is about -238 degrees Fahrenheit.

Referring to the skyline, Libeskind said, ""It was what the freedom of America stood for."" Now, Libeskind will contribute to reshaping the New York City skyline. His design has been chosen for rebuilding the World Trade Center site. It was chosen from hundreds of plans. Libeskind's design includes a tower that stands 1,776 feet tall-a number that has symbolic meaning. It stands for the year the Declaration of Independence was signed and the United States gained freedom from Britain. The tower would be the tallest structure in the world. The new design will include a memorial to the nearly 3,000 people killed when the twin towers fell on September 11, 2001, after terrorist attacks. The plan also includes indoor gardens that will fill the top floors of the tower. Officials estimate that restoring the site will take between 10 and 12 years. Because of the complexity of the design, planners also say that the final design could look different from the original design. All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation. "
46,4,"Light can be used for digital communications - for example, in Morse code and in CD players. Light consists of transverse waves in which the electromagnetic vibrations are at 90º to the direction of travel. The speed of a wave can be calculated using its frequency and wavelength. Lasers produce intense narrow beams of light. Waves are vibrations that transfer energy from place to place without matter - solid, liquid or gas - being transferred. Think of a Mexican wave in a football crowd. The wave moves around the stadium, while each spectator stays in their seat - only moving up, and then down, when it is their turn.

The substance is known as the medium, and it can be solid, liquid or gas. Sound waves and are like this: they must travel through a medium. It is the medium that vibrates as the waves travel through it. Other waves do not need to travel through a substance. They may be able to travel through a medium, but they do not have to. Visible light, infrared rays, microwaves, and other types of Energy travelling as waves in the form of changing electrical and magnetic fields. , are like this. They can travel through empty space. Electrical or magnetic fields vibrate as the waves travel through them. All types of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, are waves. In transverse waves the vibrations are at right angles to the direction of travel, as seen in the animation below of a wave sent down a piece of string. The hand moves up and down, as does each part of the string. But the wave moves along from left to right. Water waves and s-waves - one type of seismic wave - are also transverse waves.

For your exam you need to know that lasers produce an intense narrow beam of light. You should understand what is meant by the amplitude, wavelength and frequency of a wave. As waves travel, they set up patterns of disturbance. The amplitude of a wave is its maximum disturbance from its undisturbed position. Take care: the amplitude is not the distance between the top and bottom of a wave. The wavelength of a wave is the distance between a point on one wave and the same point on the next wave. It is often easiest to measure this from the crest of one wave to the crest of the next wave, but it doesn't matter where as long as it is the same point in each wave. The frequency of a wave is the number of waves produced by a source each second. It is also the number of waves that pass a certain point each second. The unit of frequency is the hertz (Hz). It is common for kilohertz (kHz), megahertz (MHz) and gigahertz (GHz) to be used when waves have very high frequencies. For example, most people cannot hear a high-pitched sound above 20kHz, radio stations broadcast Low frequency electromagnetic radiation used to transmit information such as television and radio programmes. with frequencies of about 100MHz, while most wireless computer networks operate at 2.4GHz.

Letters and numbers are represented by a series of dots and dashes - a dash lasts three times longer than a dot. Morse code can be used to transmit signals in many different ways, including visible light, radio waves and electrical pulses. Sending information using electrical pulses requires wires, unlike visible light and radio waves, which are wireless. The use of visible light needs the transmitter and receiver to be in the line of sight. But it is more secure against eavesdroppers than radio waves. A laser - 'Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation' - produces an intense narrow beam of light. A typical laser beam might only spread out by 1m when shone onto a surface 1km away. The light waves in a laser beam are: When light waves are in the same phase, their crests all line up, as do their troughs. Laser beams are used to read information from CDs in CD players. The shiny surface of a CD contains microscopic pits in a spiral track. The pattern of pits contains digital information. The laser light is reflected off the surface of the CD as the disk spins, and is detected: the change in the amount of reflected light caused by entering or leaving a pit is interpreted as a 1 no change in the amount of reflected light is interpreted as a 0 "

51,4,"The rate of a reaction can be measured by the rate at which a substances present at the start of a chemical reaction is used up, or the rate at which a A product is a substance formed in a chemical reaction. The temperature, concentration, pressure of reacting gases, surface area of reacting solids, and the use of catalysts, are all factors which affect the rate of a reaction. Chemical reactions can only happen if reactant particles collide with enough energy. The more frequently particles collide, and the greater the proportion of collisions with enough energy, the greater the rate of reaction. Different reactions can happen at different rates. Reactions that happen slowly have a low rate of reaction. Reactions that happen quickly have a high rate of reaction. For example, the chemical of rocks is a very slow reaction: it has a low rate of reaction. Explosions are very fast reactions: they have a high rate of reaction. There are two ways to measure the rate of a reaction: substances present at the start of a chemical reaction A product is a substance formed in a chemical reaction. The method chosen depends on the reaction being studied. Sometimes it is easier to measure the change in the amount of a reactant that has been used up; sometimes it is easier to measure the change in the amount of product that has been produced. The measurement itself depends on the nature of the reactant or product: the mass of a substance - solid, liquid or gas - is measured with a balance the volume of a gas is usually measured with a gas syringe, or sometimes an upside down measuring cylinder or burette It is usual to record the mass or total volume at regular intervals and plot a graph. The readings go on the vertical axis, and the time goes on the horizontal axis. of hydrogen gas is produced in two minutes, the mean rate of reaction = 24 ÷ 2 = 12cm You will be expected to remember the factors that affect the rate of reactions, and to plot or interpret graphs from rate experiments. How to increase the rate of a reaction The rate of a reaction increases if: The concentration of a solution tells us how much of a substance is dissolved in water. Concentration is measured in moles per dm3. The higher the concentration, the more particles of the substance are present. substances present at the start of a chemical reaction the pressure of a reacting gas is increased solid reactants are broken into smaller pieces A catalyst changes the rate of a chemical reaction without being changed by the reaction itself. The graph above summarises the differences in the rate of reaction at different temperatures, concentrations and size of pieces. The steeper the line, the greater the rate of reaction. Reactions are usually fastest at the beginning, when the concentration of reactants is greatest. When the line becomes horizontal, the reaction has stopped. You will be expected to explain, in terms of particles and their collisions, why changing the conditions of a reaction changes its rate. For a chemical reaction to occur, the substances present at the start of a chemical reaction particles must collide. Collisions with too little energy do not produce a reaction.

If the concentration of a dissolved reactant is increased, or the pressure of a reacting gas is increased: there are more reactant particles in the same volume there is a greater chance of the particles colliding If a solid reactant is broken into small pieces or ground into a powder: more particles are exposed to the other reactant there is a greater chance of the particles colliding more particles have the activation energy or greater the particles collide more often, and more of the collisions result in a reaction Catalysts increase the rate of reaction without being used up. They do this by lowering the activation energy needed. With a catalyst, more collisions result in a reaction, so the rate of reaction increases. Different reactions need different catalysts. Catalysts are important in industry because they reduce costs. "

MacArthur, aboard her sailboat called set two world's records in the around-the-world race. The Vendee Globe is one of the world's toughest sailing races. Sailors must race nonstop around the world. And if that were not hard enough, all sailors must sail Ellen MacArthur, a 24-year-old Englishwoman, finished second in the 2000 Vendee Globe. She sailed about 31,000 miles in 94 days, 4 hours, 25 minutes, 40 seconds. MacArthur finished only one day after the winner, Frenchman Michel Desjoyeaux. Despite finishing in second place, MacArthur made good enough time to win two titles--the fastest woman and the youngest person ever to finish a solo around-the-world race. During the Vendee Globe voyage, MacArthur had to make repairs to her boat without losing time. She averaged ten naps a day, sleeping a total of just six hours a day. Once she awoke just in time to steer away from a giant iceberg looming 50 feet in front of her! Those difficulties were nothing compared to the one MacArthur said she faced at the finish line.

February or March - October or November? The Russian calendar was 13 days behind the rest of the world, so its February Revolution actually took place in March, and what was called the October Revolution happened in November! This fact, of course, gives a clue as to why the Romanov dynasty fell in 1917 - it was . In comparison, Italy and Spain had modernised their calendars in 1582!

55,4,"Gases such as hydrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ammonia and chlorine can be made using chemical reactions. These gases are collected in different ways, depending upon their density and solubility in water. They can be identified using different tests. If a gas is less dense than air, it is often more convenient to collect it in a gas jar or test tube by upward delivery. The gas produced in a chemical reaction is passed through a delivery tube into the gas jar, where it rises and takes up the space at the top of the jar - pushing the air in the jar down, and out at the This works well for hydrogen and ammonia, which are both less dense than air. The equipment must be used in a fume cupboard when ammonia is collected, because ammonia is harmful and has a sharp, choking smell. If a gas is denser than air, it is often more convenient to collect it in a gas jar or test tube by downward delivery. The gas produced in a chemical reaction is passed through a delivery tube into the gas jar, where it sinks and pushes the air out of the This works well for carbon dioxide and chlorine, which are both denser than air. The equipment must be used in a fume cupboard when chlorine is collected, because chlorine is toxic and has a sharp, choking smell. Sometimes gases are collected over water. The gas produced in a reaction is bubbled through a trough of water and into an upturned gas jar filled with water. The bubbles of gas collect in the top of the gas jar and push the water out of the bottom. If enough gas is produced it completely replaces the water in the gas jar. A glass lid is then slid under the gas jar, which is then removed from the trough of water and turned the right way up. This works well for insoluble gases such as hydrogen, or gases that do not dissolve easily in water, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. Ammonia and chlorine are readily soluble in water and are not collected this way. You need to know how to collect gases produced in reactions by upward and downward delivery, over water and using a gas syringe. You need to be able to explain the method of collection if you are given information about the density and solubility of the gas concerned. The table summarises the ways in which hydrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ammonia and chlorine may be collected. Note that all these gases may be collected using a gas syringe. You need to know how to test for hydrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ammonia and chlorine. A lighted wooden splint makes a popping sound in a test tube of hydrogen. A glowing wooden splint relights in a test tube of oxygen. A lighted wooden splint goes out in a test tube of carbon dioxide but this happens with other gases, too. It is better to bubble the test gas through limewater - calcium hydroxide solution. Carbon dioxide turns limewater cloudy white. Ammonia has a characteristic sharp, choking smell. It also makes damp red litmus paper turn blue. Ammonia forms a white smoke of ammonium chloride when hydrogen chloride gas, from concentrated hydrochloric acid, is held near it. Chlorine has a characteristic sharp, choking smell. It also makes damp blue litmus paper turn red, and then bleaches it white. Chlorine makes damp starch-iodide paper turn blue-black. "
56,2,"Our sun is a seething ball of hot gases. The sun is always active, but for the rest of this year, the sun will be more active than usual, scientists say. Activity on the sun can affect Earth. It can disrupt communications. It can also cause the , which are shifting curtains of colored light. When the sun is very active, dark spots, called , dot the sun's surface. Each day, scientists can see more than 100 sunspots on the sun. Sunspots slowly change shape and move across the sun's surface. Sunspots have a temperature of 7,000 degrees Fahrenheit (F). That might seem hot, but it is cooler than the rest of the sun's surface, which is a sweltering 10,000 degrees F. Because sunspots are cooler than the rest of the surface, they look dark--almost like shadows. When the sun is very active, huge explosions can rip across its surface. Those explosions, called , propel solar material into space. About three or four days after a flare erupts on the sun, the flare may collide with Earth's atmosphere. When a flare reaches Earth, it can damage satellites orbiting Earth, power stations, and electrical equipment. In July, a huge flare interfered with communication satellites. The sun is about 93 million miles from Earth. A car traveling at 55 miles per hour would take 193 years to get from Earth to the sun. It takes a beam of light eight minutes to travel from the surface of the sun to Earth. When solar flares reach our planet, they can make gases in Earth's atmosphere glow. The glowing gases form the northern lights. The northern lights can be many different colors: red, blue, green, or a combination of colors. Scientists say the best time to see the northern lights is when the sun is active. People in many parts of the United States should be able to see the northern lights in the night sky this fall. People who live in the northern part of the United States have the best chance of seeing the dancing lights. To see them, the sky must be very dark. senior editor Fran Downey once saw an aurora (the northern lights) while visiting Washington state. ""It began as a dull green light and got brighter and brighter, until it lit up the sky,"" Downey said. ""In the distance, I could hear coyotes howling at the aurora. It was beautiful."" measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc. All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation. "
57,2,"On March 16, Michael Yachinich of Chicago Heights, Illinois, heard a smoke alarm go off on the stairs to his upstairs bedroom. Michael, age 7, quickly went into the living room where his mother was sleeping. He woke her up, and the two quickly left the house. They ran to a neighbor's house and called 911. The fire was quickly contained by firefighters. Michael had recently participated in his school's ""Great Escape"" project for Fire Prevention Week. Michael and his family knew how to exit their home safely during a fire. Firefighter Terrence Campbell of the Glenwood Fire Department said that Michael showed good fire safety behavior. He acted quickly to help his mom leave the house and report the fire, as well as by using a home escape plan to escape danger. ""I feel that his actions from the 1999 ""Great Escape"" project helped Michael know what to do,"" Campbell said. An escape plan also helped save the lives of the Walker family in Ontario, Canada. Shortly after 3 a.m. on February 18, 1999, a fire began in the ground floor apartment below the Walker apartment. The family awoke to find their apartment filling with smoke. Everyone reacted immediately. The family put their home fire escape plan into action, and everyone left the building right away and went to their meeting place outside. By the time they got there, flames were racing through the apartment. Earlier in the school year, 9-year-old twins Ashley and Ryan Walker participated in their school's ""Great Escape"" fire safety program. Mr. Walker says the twins helped the family know what to do when the fire began. ""They pushed the fire procedures,"" he said. ""They learned them at school and had us practice how to get out."" Although the idea of a fire starting in your home is scary, you can use the prevention skills taught in your school to keep fires from starting in your home. But, if a fire does start, you can prepare your family and yourself by having a ""Great Escape"" plan and practicing it at least twice a year! measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.

In the past, scientists had to drill holes or take samples from . Artifacts are objects made by people in the past. The machine can tell the scientists what the objects are made of. That can help them learn where the rocks used to make the tools came from. For example, the scientists figured out that tools found in Alaska were made from rocks 300 miles away.

61,3,"Writer's tricks - Persuading the reader Some persuasive texts aim simply at persuading us to do something, particularly charity leaflets, holiday brochures and adverts. Others may try in more subtle ways; newspaper and magazine articles may try to persuade us to agree with a certain view. Try to convince us to do or agree with something, such as spending money or agreeing with a certain belief. Contain a mixture of fact and opinion. Emphasise key points by using subheadings, repetition, memorable phrases and emotive language. Often use a personal style so that the text seems to speak directly to the reader. Show clear links between points, such as ""if you donate £20 you will be helping a sick animal"" or ""using our deodorant will attract women"". Stories can also be persuasive as well. A writer may want you to like or dislike a character. The way that they describe a character can persuade you to do either of these. Look at this extract from 'Jane Eyre': John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten; large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at the table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye with flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mamma had taken him home for a month or two, 'on account of his delicate health'. How does Charlotte Brontë try to persuade, or convince, us that John Reed is an unpleasant character in this paragraph? She makes him sound unattractive, with his ""dingy and unwholesome skin"" and ""heavy limbs"". She suggests that he is greedy as he ""gorged himself habitually at the table"". She suggests that this is why he is so unhealthy, so that we don't feel sorry for him. She makes him sound spoilt because his mother is keeping him home from school, even though his so-called ""delicate health"" is his own fault. Use your knowledge to help Spherox find his way home.

62,3,"Ratio - Equivalent ratios and simplest form Ratio - Equivalent ratios and simplest form If you are making orange squash and you mix one part orange to four parts water, then the ratio of orange to water will be 1:4 (1 to 4). If you use 1 litre of orange, you will use 4 litres of water (1:4). If you use 2 litres of orange, you will use 8 litres of water (2:8). If you use 10 litres of orange, you will use 40 litres of water (10:40). Both sides of the ratio can be multiplied or divided by the same number to give an equivalent ratio. Write the ratio 40:28 in its simplest form. To work this out, look for a number that will divide into 40 and 28. 2 divides into both numbers, so 40:28 can be written as 20:14. You can divide these by 2, so the simplified ratio is No number divides into 10 and 7, so 10:7 is the simplest form of the ratio. Join Questionaut's quest to find his friend's hat.

Most reptiles have clawed feet and walk on four legs. Can you name a reptile that has no legs? A snake! Other reptiles include alligators, crocodiles, and lizards. Most reptiles lay eggs on land. Baby reptiles hatch from the eggs. A leaf-tailed gecko, like the one shown on the cover, lays two eggs at a time. The corn snake lays up to 30 eggs at once! The boa constrictor is a snake that does not lay eggs. It gives birth to baby snakes. An amphibian is an animal that spends part of its life in water and part on land. Most have smooth, wet skin. Frogs, toads, newts, and salamanders are amphibians. Most amphibians hatch from eggs. The eggs are usually in or near water. Young amphibians breathe through gills. When they get older, they breathe with lungs. Most adult amphibians live on land. For example, you young frogs that hatch from eggs are called tadpoles. Tadpoles live in water and move like fish.

Ships use special sensors to locate mines. Within the next few months, that same technology will be used to protect something a lot smaller and slower--manatees. In the winter, West Indian manatees are found in many of the warm, shallow waters around Florida. . A lock is an area of water in a canal enclosed by a set of gates at each end. The gates open to allow a ship to enter. The lock then fills with water to raise the ship or drains water to lower it. A lock allows a ship to move from one elevation to another. Canal locks, however, can be deadly traps for manatees. An average of ten manatees a year have been killed in the gates in the past decade. A little more than a year ago, the canal lock at Port Canaveral, Florida, was fitted with sensors like those used by the U.S. Navy to detect underwater mines. The sensors work using sound waves, said Larry Taylor, the engineer overseeing the project. ""When the canal lock sensors [detect] a manatee, they stop the doors from closing,"" said Taylor. Within a few weeks after the Port Canaveral installation, the sensors had saved seven manatees, Taylor said. He said there are plans to install the sensors at seven more Florida canal locks.

Instead, amateur athletes, such as Terry Brands and Cary Kolat, will go for Olympic gold. The 2000 Summer Olym-pics will take place in Sydney, Australia. Real Wrestling. Real Heroes. That is the , or slogan, of this year's Olympic wrestling team. The wrestlers use this motto because they are proud to wrestle for their country. They want people to know that the competition of Olympic wrestling is tougher than the professional wrestling of Mankind and Shane McMahon. In the Olympic Games, there are two styles of wrestling, . In Greco-Roman, wrestlers can use only their arms and upper body. In freestyle, wrestlers can use their legs to trip their opponent. Unlike pro wrestling, the two challengers wrestle on a padded mat, not in a ring with ropes. They use certain moves to force their opponent to the mat. Greg Strobel, a U.S. Olympic wrestling coach, says pro wrestling is meant to entertain. He says it is not a sport, like Olympic wrestling. Chris Benoit and the Undertaker are two famous pro wrestlers. Many fans enjoy pro wrestling because of the action, fireworks, and costumes. However, pro wrestling is more of a show than a real contest, said Ron Buck, a sports reporter. According to many critics, the moves and punches in a professional match are fake. U.S. Olympic wrestlers do not get paid to compete in the Olympics. For many team members, the chance to win a gold medal is a dream come true. Though pro wrestlers get more fame and attention, Olympic wrestlers consider representing the United States an honor. That is why, to many fans, these wrestlers are real heroes. Olympic wrestlers compete only against others who are in the same weight class. Why is that an important rule? measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.

76,4,"During the 15th century Western civilisation experienced a process of profound change, which historians call the (meaning 'rebirth'). The beginning of the Renaissance is often dated from AD 1453, when the fall of Constantinople drove many scholars with knowledge of Greek and Roman learning westwards. The period historians call the lasted from about 1450 to about 1750. Some knowledge of Western civilisation at the time of the will help you understand the medicine of the Early Modern Age. In the 15th century AD, there was a 'rebirth' of European civilisation. Governments - such as that of Henry VIII - were strong and . The economy boomed and trade prospered. People could afford doctors. Artists (such as Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and Titian) revolutionised painting - this led them to study the body in more detail, and was connected to improved (eg the fabulous illustrations for 'Fabric of the Human Body' by John Stephen of Calcar, one of Titian's students). There was a revival of learning. Universities established schools of medicine. The Renaissance saw the beginning of - which involved conducting an experiment, collecting observations, then coming to a conclusion. At first, scholars merely claimed that they were renewing the perfection it had amongst the ancient teachers', but soon they began to conduct experiments which led them to question the knowledge of the Greeks and Romans. This was vital for the development of medicine. allowed new ideas to spread more quickly around Europe. The discovery of America by Columbus meant that new foods and medicines were brought back from the (especially gunpowder) led to soldiers getting different sorts of wounds, which battlefield doctors had to deal with. Although the Renaissance saw an improvement in medical knowledge, particularly of anatomy and physiology, many people rejected the new ideas. Further, doctors still did not manage to use their discoveries to develop better cures for their patients, because they had still not discovered the role that 15th-century manuscript illumination of a public dissection Bezoar is a stone that grows in the stomach of a goat found in the Middle East. It was thought to be an antidote to poison (the word is Persian, and means 'counterpoison'). The French surgeon-doctor Paré tested this in a crude and cruel scientific experiment. He gave poison to a condemned criminal, followed by bezoar, and then observed what happened: Some years ago, a gentleman boasted before King Charles that bezoar was an antidote for all poisons ... It was an easy matter to make trial of this claim on those condemned to be hanged [and a criminal] had poison administered to him ... An hour after, I found him on the ground on his hands and feet like an animal, with his tongue hanging out of his mouth, his eyes wild, vomiting, with blood pouring from his ears, nose and mouth. Eventually he died in great torment, seven hours after I gave him the poison. I opened his body and found the bottom of the stomach black and dry, as if it had been burned, whereby I realised that he had been given sublimate of mercury, whose force the bezoar could not stop. Therefore the king commanded: Burn it! When you have read this famous source about bezoar, can you find evidence that Paré conducted a scientific experiment? Paré followed a clear scientific path, with four steps, consisting of: ""...died in great torment, seven hours after I gave him the poison ... found the bottom of the stomach black and dry, as if it had been burned"" ""...whose force the bezoar could not stop. Therefore the king commanded: Burn it!"" "

This table shows the weights of children in a class. To estimate the mean weight, you know that 7 children are between 30kg and 40kg, but you don't know exactly how much they weigh, so assume that they all weigh 35kg (the midpoint of the group). Do the same for all the other groups: a) Estimate of mean = 1215 ÷ 25 = b) The modal class is the class that has the highest frequency. In this case the modal class is How mean are you?

God has shown people how they should live (eg the Ten Commandments (a list of religious and moral rules that were given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai); Jesus’ life and teaching), but it is up to them to decide whether or not to follow God’s instructions. The story of humanity’s battle with good and evil is told in the story of Adam and Eve in the (Genesis 3). Adam and Eve chose to disobey God by eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. This is called the Fall. Some people believe that as a result of Adam and Eve’s first sins, each human is born with a tendency towards evil. This is called As well as a power for good there is also a power for evil. Traditionally this is said to be , one of the archangels who disobeyed God and was thrown out of heaven (Luke 10:18).

82,4,"A musical device is a technique for achieving a particular artistic effect. Imitation is when one instrument or voice plays a tune that has just been played by another. For example, a flute may imitate a tune just played by the oboe. Sometimes imitations can contain slight changes to the tune, to make it more interesting. These changes might be : changes in octave. It could be played higher or lower. These three words mean the same thing. 'Ostinato' is more often used when describing serious (classical and some world and folk) music. 'Riff' is more often used when describing pop music and 'Loop' is used in Techno or modern dance music. A Riff or ostinato is a repeated pattern of notes. Here is an example of an ostinato from 'Carmina Burana'. The ostinato is played on the bass instruments: Here is an example of a riff from a disco track of the 1970s. You can hear the riff played on the guitar. Finally, here is a loop from modern techno music. It is called a loop because this is the process used on the computer when it is played on a program called a sequencer. Here, you can hear loops on the drums and the synthesised xylophone sound. A break or fill-in is when the drums play a short solo. They may do this for one of several reasons, eg To signal the beginning of a chorus, verse or section change. at the beginning of the drum part to announce their entry. to highlight something in the music, such as important lyrics. is a pattern of notes which goes up or down in pitch every time it is repeated. Sequences can be divided between instruments. Here is a simple rising sequence. The first four notes set the pattern, which is then repeated over and over, each time higher in pitch.

A mordent is played by playing the note, then the note above and finally back to the 1st note. Improvising is when a player makes up the music on the spot. It is common in jazz, popular, folk and world music. Sometimes the musician uses the notes of a scale to improvise on, such as the blues scale or pentatonic scale. Often, in a pop song, there will be a long improvised solo on a guitar or keyboard between verses. Jazz and blues music often contains a lot of improvisation in the form of both solos and tutti passages. A drone is usually formed by two notes a 5th apart.

The chords above the bass may change, but the bass note stays the same. In this example, the pedal note is C which you can see in the bass part. The term pedal comes from the days when the bass notes would be played by the pedals on an organ. 'Ground bass' is the term used in Baroque music where a bass part is repeated over and over again. Where an ostinato pattern might be very short, a ground bass can last many bars before it is repeated. Listen to this extract of music by , and comment on any devices you hear. Comment also on the use of instruments and voices. The music has a singer and trumpet. The parts copy each other all the way through. The voice goes very high. The trumpet is very loud. The music is very interesting and it makes me feel like I want to listen to this type of music again. . Talvin has scored some points for mentioning the imitation, the singer and the trumpet. At the end, he starts to give his own opinions on the music which is not part of the question, so he scored no marks for that section. The music has a female singer with a trumpet, harpsichord and strings in it. The trumpet part copies the tune that the singer has just sung but plays some 'twiddly' bits as well. There is a part where all the instruments drop out leaving just the singer. . Sarah has spotted the main musical devices, but has not named and identified them using proper musical language. Where she says that the trumpet part 'copies' she should have said 'imitates'. Also when the instruments 'drop out', she should have said 'unaccompanied'. The music begins with a soprano soloist accompanied by a double bass and harpsichord. After a phrase, the trumpet imitates the soprano but adds ornaments (trills) to make the imitation more interesting. The trumpet is joined by the violins which play the melody. The solo then sings the next phrase unaccompanied which is again imitated by the trumpet adding more ornaments. The very last vocal phrase contains a short rising sequence. . Geeta has missed nothing here! She started by correctly identifying the instruments including the correct type of voice. She uses words like 'phrase', 'imitation' and 'ornaments' to describe what is going on in the music. Although Geeta got the mark for mentioning the ornaments in the trumpet part, she goes further by correctly identifying the type of ornament, which was a trill. "

88,3,"Decimals - Multiplying a decimal by a whole number Decimals - Multiplying a decimal by a whole number Multiplying a decimal by a whole number is the same as multiplying two whole numbers. Remember: If there is one digit after the decimal point in the question, there will be one digit after the decimal point in the answer. If there are two digits after the decimal point in the question, there will be two digits after the decimal point in the answer. a) There were two digits after the decimal point in the question (4 and 3), so you must have two digits after the decimal point in the answer. b) There was one digit after the decimal point in the question, so you must have one digit after the decimal point in the answer. The answer is therefore 12.0, but this can then be given as 12. Check that you have a sensible answer by finding an approximate solution. In the above example you were asked to calculate 2.4 × 5. 2 × 5 = 10, so you are looking for an answer which is slightly bigger than 10. So an answer of 12 seems sensible.

The 11-year-old boy regularly practices his kickflip and heelflip at a skate park in his neighborhood in New Haven, Connecticut. aren't in your vocabulary, welcome to the world of skateboarding. Both are skateboarding tricks. Alex is one of millions of kids who have made skateboarding one of the fastest-growing sports. There are an estimated 12 million skateboarders in the United States. The number of girls who have gotten in on the action has also grown. Thanks in part to the X Games and top skating athlete Tony Hawk, skateboarding has exploded in popularity. What is so appealing about the sport? ""I like to skateboard because when I see people at the skate parks and on television, I think I can be that good someday,"" Alex told Although kids like Alex may be riding for the thrill of the sport, experts say skateboarding is a great form of exercise. It gets kids moving and keeps them in shape. The benefits don't stop there either. Skateboarding builds concentration skills and motivates kids to , or to keep trying, to learn a new skill. Although Alex also plays baseball and basketball, team sports are not for all kids. Skateboarding lets kids stay active and have fun without the pressure of a team sport. Skateboarding traces its roots to southern California. At one time, the sport got a bad rap for being a Before towns and cities across the country built skate parks, many skateboarders were injured on public streets. They often performed tricks down stairs and across railings on buildings. Today, the sport's reputation is getting a lift. The skate park in New Haven where Alex practices is one of more than 1,000 that have popped up nationwide in recent years. Skate parks contain ramps and other devices for kids to Officials hope that skate parks will encourage skaters to practice in a safe environment. Although most skate parks require riders to wear helmets and other safety gear, it's hard to avoid the occasional cut. Wearing a helmet the correct way helps to make skateboarding a safer sport. Many skateboarders, however, are quick to point out that their sport is no more dangerous than bike riding or football. For Alex, skateboarding gives him a chance to spend time with his friends. ""It's really fun!"" he says. Wheel sports--skateboarding, bike riding, and in-line skating--can be a lot of fun. They are also good ways to get moving. Follow these tips for a safe ride: Make sure the helmet fits well. (If your helmet rocks forward or backward or from side to side, it's not protecting your head properly.) Wear wrist guards, elbow pads, and knee pads. If skateboarding or team sports aren't for you, don't sweat it. There are a lot of ways you can stay active. Here are a few ideas.

95,1,"Animals get a new home at the National Zoo. You don't have to travel to Asia to see sloth bears slurp up insects. You can see the shaggy-coated creatures at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. The zoo opened a new exhibit, called the Asia Trail, in October. Sloth bears and six other species, or types, of animals from Asia have new homes at the National Zoo. Those animals face several threats in the wild. Before the Asia Trail opened, the animals lived in tight spaces. Now they have twice the room. The changes are part of a 10-year plan to update the zoo. ""This is a giant leap forward for the National Zoo,"" says its director, John Berry. ""Our goal is to be the world's finest zoo by 2016."" Giant panda cub Tai Shan (tie-SHAHN) and his parents are the stars of the show. They help draw huge crowds to the zoo. Three million people are expected to visit this year. The giant pandas' new home includes more trees for climbing. Pandas like water, so their area has a waterfall and pools. Fog machines help make the exhibit more like their habitat, or natural home, in China. Visitors now have closer views of the giant pandas and other animals. ""You can see, hear, touch, and even smell the zoo's science,"" says Susan Ades, head of the new design. The National Zoo is home to 2,000 animals. Along with fishing cats, clouded leopards, sloth bears, and Japanese giant salamanders, the creatures here live on the Asia Trail. Giant panda cub Tai Shan relaxes while chewing bamboo at the zoo. Red pandas use their bushy tails to cover their bodies when they're cold. Is it important for zoos to create homes that are like the animals' natural habitats? Why or why not?

96,0,School has changed in some ways over time. Let’s learn about those ways. Schools did not always have computers. How is school today different from school many years ago? Then: Many schoolhouses had only one classroom. Students of all ages learned together. Now: Most school buildings have many classrooms. Students in each class are about the same age. Students listened carefully to a phonograph. That is a machine that plays recordings. Students use computers during lessons. They wear headphones to listen and learn. Then: Students raised their hands to answer questions. The teacher called on students to respond. Now: Students still raise their hands to answer questions. That is one way school has not changed.

These acids can contaminate drinking water, damage plants and water creatures and buildings. It is believed to be caused by pollution and, maybe, natural activity such as volcanic eruptions. which can damage buildings and kill plants. If there is not enough oxygen present to burn the fuels completely, incomplete combustion takes place. , a very poisonous gas, is formed. Incomplete combustion also releases very small particles of carbon into the air. This makes buildings dirty and can cause breathing difficulties.

100,4,"Account for the emergence of NICRA in 1967? Teacher's notes: This question is worth 6 marks in the exam. Give yourself 7 - 8 minutes to answer it. Mark Scheme: In History you are marked by levels. The higher the level the more marks you get and so the higher grade you will achieve. The answer will provide few reasons for the emergence of NICRA with no real explanations offered. The answer will provide more reasons with some explanations offered. The answer will provide a number of reasons with detailed explanations. NICRA was set up because of events in the USA where Martin Luther King Jr. was leading a similar campaign in America in the 1960s. At the same time discrimination in Northern Ireland was still continuing. NICRA campaigned for ""One Man, One Vote"". John would get a level 1 for this answer. The candidate only touches on the influence of the USA and events in Northern Ireland. The candidate does not develop the two points to answer the question fully and directly. NICRA emerged due to a number of events and influences. A major factor in its emergence was the impact of the 1947 Education Act. This made Catholics more confident in the 1960s to demand civil rights. A further influence was the establishment of the Campaign for Social Justice in 1964. This organisation highlighted the forms of discrimination that existed in Northern Ireland by the mid 1960s. This helped bring about the establishment of NICRA in 1967. A final factor to explain the emergence of NICRA was Labour's victory in the 1964 General Election. Paul would get a level 2 for this answer. The candidate makes two valid points in the first paragraph. However other important factors are omitted and he does not explain the last point in the second paragraph. The emergence of NICRA can be explained by a number of events, both within Northern Ireland and outside of Northern Ireland. The 1947 Education Act helped to create a larger professional and educated Catholic class in Northern Ireland. It was more assertive and confident in demanding civil rights for all by the mid 1960s. Also within Northern Ireland there was the Campaign for Social Justice that was set up in 1964. This organisation acted as a forerunner for the emergence of NICRA in 1967. Furthermore within Northern Ireland by the mid 1960s, members of a number of political parties, as well as labour and republican groups were working to establish a civil rights movement. They felt that O'Neill's government had done little to address grievances in voting, housing, policing and employment. Outside of Northern Ireland there were other influences. The 1960s witnessed the emergence of a civil rights movement in the USA. It was having some success and this inspired a similar movement in Northern Ireland. Also in 1964 a Labour government was elected in Britain. Labour was seen as being more sympathetic to the nationalist cause. This may have raised the expectations of Catholics into believing that a protest group campaigning for civil rights might succeed. A year later over 100 MPs in Britain formed the Campaign for Democracy in Ulster. This further raised the expectations of Catholics and influenced the establishment of NICRA. Michael would get a level 3 for this answer. This response is very direct and extremely comprehensive. The candidate is aware of all the important factors that account for the emergence of NICRA. "
101,4,"Electricity is a very convenient source of energy, which can be generated using different energy resources. Renewable energy resources such as solar power and wind power can meet some of the UK's electricity needs. Each energy resource has advantages and disadvantages. Energy transfer for the generation of electricity from a fossil fuel when they are burned. They are fossil fuels because they were formed from the About three-quarters of the electricity generated in the UK comes from power stations fuelled by fossil fuels. Below is an energy transfer diagram for the generation of electricity from a fossil fuel such as coal. Fossil fuels are non-renewable energy resources. Their supply is and they will eventually run out. Fossil fuels do not renew themselves, while fuels such as wood can be renewed endlessly. , which adds to the greenhouse effect and increases global warming. Of the three fossil fuels, for a given amount of energy released, coal produces the most carbon dioxide and natural gas produces the least. Coal and oil release sulfur dioxide gas when they burn, which causes breathing problems for living creatures and contributes to acid rain. You should be able to outline how electricity is generated using wind energy. The wind is produced as a result of giant The transfer of heat energy through a moving liquid or gas. currents in the Earth's atmosphere, which are driven by heat energy from the sun. This means that the kinetic energy in wind is a renewable energy resource: as long as the sun exists, the wind will too. Wind turbines have huge blades mounted on a tall tower. The blades are connected to a The part at the top of the tower of a wind turbine. The blades of the turbine are joined to the nacelle, which contains gears linked to a generator. or housing that contains gears linked to a An 123 electromagnetic device that produces electricity when it is turned. . As the wind blows, it transfers some of its kinetic energy to the blades, which turn and drive the generator. Several wind turbines may be grouped together in windy locations to form wind farms. and there are no fuel costs. No harmful polluting gases are produced. You may wish to view this BBC News item from 2006 about the arguments for and against wind power. for people living near them. The amount of electricity generated depends on the strength of the wind. If there is no wind, there is no electricity. Electricity can be generated using water in several ways. The water in the sea rises and falls because of waves on the surface. Wave machines use the in this movement to drive electricity generators. Huge amounts of water move in and out of river mouths each day because of the tides. A tidal barrage is a barrier built over a river estuary to make use of the kinetic energy in the moving water. The barrage contains electricity generators, which are driven by the water rushing through tubes in the barrage. Like tidal barrages, hydroelectric power stations use the kinetic energy in moving water. But the water comes from built across a river valley. The water high up behind the dam contains The energy stored by an object lifted up against the force of gravity. . This is transferred to kinetic energy as the water rushes down through tubes inside the dam. The moving water drives electrical generators, which may be built inside the dam. Water power in its various forms is and there are no fuel costs. No harmful polluting gases are produced. Tidal barrages and hydroelectric power stations are very reliable and can be turned on quickly. It has been difficult to scale up the designs for wave machines to produce large amounts of electricity. Tidal barrages of estuary species, including wading birds. Hydroelectricity dams and push people from their homes. The rotting vegetation underwater releases methane, which is a greenhouse gas. You should be able to outline how solar energy is used to generate electricity and to produce hot water. Solar cells are devices that convert light energy directly into electrical energy. You may have seen small solar cells in calculators. Larger arrays of solar cells are used to power road signs in remote areas, and even larger arrays are used to power satellites in orbit around Earth. Solar panels do not generate electricity, but rather they heat up water. They are often located on the roofs of buildings where they can receive heat energy from the sun. The diagram outlines how they work. A pump pushes cold water from the storage tank through pipes in the solar panel. The water is heated by heat energy from the sun and returns to the tank. In some systems, a conventional boiler may be used to increase the temperature of the water. and there are no fuel costs. No harmful polluting gases are produced. , so the cost of their electricity is high solar panels may only produce very hot water in very sunny climates, and in cooler areas may need to be supplemented with a conventional boiler although warm water can be produced even on cloudy days, neither solar cells nor solar panels work at night "
102,2,"You're probably familiar with this saying: An apple a day keeps the doctor away. There has been a lot of health advice in the news lately about what is good for your body. Sometimes it becomes difficult to tell what is true and what is considered a myth. is a made-up story that is passed down from generation to generation. Myths often become accepted as the truth. Weekly Reader spoke with a few health experts to find out the truth behind some common beliefs. : An apple a day keeps the doctor away. : Although eating this fruit won't cure an illness, apples are a healthful food choice. ""[Apples] are good for you,"" said nutrition expert Dr. Melvin Heyman. ""They contain nutrients."" are vitamins and minerals that your body needs to stay healthy. Apples are also a good source of fiber, which can decrease the risk of heart disease later in life. : You should let a cut breathe. : Contrary to popular belief, cuts do not need to breathe. ""The open cut or scrape should be covered,"" said skin expert Dr. Amy Harned. According to Dr. Harned, it's important to wash the wound first. Then, apply an antibiotic ointment and cover the cut with a bandage. Leaving a cut uncovered can allow germs to infect it. : Eating carrots will improve your eyesight. : Carrots are rich in vitamin A, which helps keep your eyes healthy. According to eye expert Dr. Timothy Wingert, ""Eating carrots will not improve your eyesight. But eating carrots is part of a well-balanced diet. Carrots have nutrients that help your eyes to function properly."" Carrots also make a tasty snack. : You can hurt your eyes by sitting too close to the TV. : There is some truth to this advice. According to Dr. Wingert, sitting too close to the television for long periods of time makes eyes tired and can cause eyestrain. ""Generally, it is more comfortable on your eyes to view the television from at least 5 feet from the screen,"" he says. So, back up from that television or, better yet, turn it off!

105,4,"Cooking brings about chemical changes in food. The texture and taste of food changes when it is cooked, and cooking helps to kill harmful microbes. Baking powder contains sodium hydrogencarbonate. This breaks down when heated, releasing carbon dioxide that helps cake mixtures to rise during baking. Some food can be eaten raw, such as carrots and apples. But some food is usually cooked before it is eaten, such as meat and fish. There are many ways to cook food, including by: Notice that all of these methods involve heating the food to a that can cause disease. The high temperatures involved in cooking kill these microbes. Cooking also makes food easier to digest. It can improve the food’s appearance, texture and flavour, too. For example, bread turns brown as it is toasted. Sugars in the bread break down to form carbon: This change needs heat energy from the toaster, and it cannot be reversed. Eggs and meat are good sources of protein. The protein molecules change shape as a result of the heat energy they absorb. This causes changes in the appearance and texture of the eggs and meat when they are cooked. For example: Egg white solidifies and becomes white instead of transparent. Meat becomes firmer and turns from red to brown. Potatoes are a good source of carbohydrate, mainly as a complex carbohydrate called starch. Raw potato is hard and has an unpleasant taste. Potato becomes softer when is cooked, the starch is converted into simple sugars, and the potato becomes sweeter. Baking powder is used for baking cakes. It contains sodium hydrogencarbonate, which breaks down when heated to form carbon dioxide gas. The carbon dioxide helps to make the cake mixture rise, so that the cakes are light and fluffy. Here is the word equation for the reaction: Carbon dioxide can be detected using a simple laboratory test. turns cloudy white when carbon dioxide is bubbled through it. You should be able to write the balanced symbol equation for the thermal decomposition of sodium hydrogencarbonate, found in baking powder. Here are the word and symbol equations for this reaction: The shapes of protein molecules change irreversibly during cooking. This change is called . We say that proteins become denatured when heated. For example, the proteins in eggs and meat are denatured by cooking. When potato is cooked, changes happen in the cell wall of potato cells. Cell walls are made of a tough substance called cellulose. During cooking, this substance breaks down and becomes soluble. This makes the potato easier to digest. "

Scríobh litir chuig cara ag cur síos ar an teach agus ar an cheantar. Luaigh na rudaí seo a leanas: (approx. 120 - 150 focal) Cén uair a tháinig tú chuig an cheantar? Déan cur síos ar an teach nua An bhfuil sé níos fearr ná an ceantar a raibh tú i do chónaí ann? Cad é a dhéanfaidh tú sa cheantar nua? Now read through the model answer written by Peadar. It contains no mistakes. Tá brón orm nár scríobh mé le fada ach bhog mo chlann go dtí teach nua mí ó shin. Tá an teach suite ar imeall na cathrach, faoin tuath. Is teach mór scoite é agus is breá liom é. Tá sé níos mó ná an seanteach - bhí an teach eile róbheag dúinn. Tá deich seomra ar fad ann - ceithre cinn thuas staighre agus sé cinn thíos staighre. Tá lúcháir orm mar tá mo sheomra féin agam anois - buíochas le Dia! Ar an drochuair, ní maith liom an ceantar nua mar tá sé róchiúin. Bhí an ceantar ina raibh mé níos fearr mar bhí cuid mhór le déanamh ag daoine óga. Bhí na háiseanna níos fearr fosta. Chuala mé go bhfuil Club na nÓg sa cheantar nua. Rachaidh mé Dé hAoine seo chugainn. Beidh mé ábalta dul ag iascaireacht anseo fosta mar tá loch mór in aice leis an teach. Caithfidh tú teacht ar cuairt - an deireadh seachtaine seo chugainn, b'fhéidir! A good piece of writing at this level will contain: a language style appropriate to a letter to a friend - an address, date, an introduction and a conclusion. a range of tenses - past/present / future some complex sentences and a range of structures ideas and opinions that are developed and justified Think about why Peadar's answer is good. Compare your answer with his and then move on to the next page to see the teacher's view The account contains a range of verbs in the past ( ) and future tenses (Rachaidh / Beidh). - on the outskirts of the city Some complex sentences and a range of structures tá brón orm nár scríobh mé le fada - I'm sorry I haven't written for a long time - you'll have to come on a visit cuid mhór le déanamh ag daoine óga - a lot for young people to do Peadar added extra detail where relevant - Ideas and opinions that are developed and justified Peadar said the area he used to live in was better and went on to give details of this. ( Is breá liom é / Tá lúcháir orm Read the question carefully. Identify the tenses you will need. Writing a brief diagram or plan first will help focus your ideas. Think about material you have prepared for your Presentation / Conversation - is any of it useful here? Writing each task as a separate paragraph is a good way to organise your answer. Try to keep the information in sequence - it helps to make sure everything has been covered and makes it easier to mark! Use a suitable writing style - a letter will need a date/address/an opening and a closing statement. will not need any of these. Do not write a letter if asked for an account and vice versa. Is it clear and easy to understand with no repetition of language? Have you checked spelling and used a wide range of grammar structures? Are the tenses used the correct ones? You will usually need to include the Have you included a wide range of vocabulary, idioms and phrases and used them in a natural way? They add a lot to your writing. Have you included link words where possible? eg. Have you given an opinion / preference or point of view? eg. Sílim /Ní shílim go bhfuil... Shíl mé / Níor shíl mé go raibh... Bhí / Ní raibh mé sásta mar... Tá / Níl mé sásta mar... Have you developed the tasks where appropriate by adding some extra information? This will make your answer more varied and interesting. Have you stuck to the word limit - not gone under and not gone over by too many words? Have you covered each task? It is a good idea to tick each one off when completed. Be sure to treat each task equally as they all carry equal marks. Cheannaigh do theaghlach teach nua i gceantar eile. Tá do chara ag teacht ar cuairt. Scríobh litir chuig do chara ag cur síos ar an teach agus ar an cheantar. Luaigh na rudaí seo a leanas: (thart fá 120 - 150 focal ).

109,2,"A new glass walkway will allow visitors to step out over the Grand Canyon. Terrified of heights? Then you might not want to step out on a glass-bottomed walkway that will jut out from the edge of the Grand Canyon. Beginning this January, thrill seekers will be able to walk along a 70-foot horse-shoe-shaped walkway and look down to see the Colorado River gushing and flowing 4,000 feet below. ""It's a whole new way to experience the Grand Canyon,"" says spokesperson Sheri Yellowhawk. The skywalk area will also feature a Native American village and a Western-themed town. The walkway will have a glass bottom and sides and will be supported by steel beams. The skywalk will be able to hold 120 people comfortably. However, Yellowhawk says it is designed to hold up to 72 million pounds! The Grand Canyon, in northern Arizona, is a massive , or narrow passage. The canyon was carved by the Colorado River as it cut a channel through rock over millions of years. The gorge stretches more than 270 miles. Park officials hope that the new walkway will encourage more tourists to come visit the amazing natural landmark. measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.

110,3,"To divide a large number by a 1-digit number you can set it out like this: 7 goes into 9 once with 2 remaining (remainder 2), so put a 1 above the 9 and carry the 2 to the tens column. 7 goes into 26 three times, remainder 5, so put 3 over the 6 and carry 5 to the hundreds column. 7 goes into 54 seven times, remainder 5 so put 7 over the 4 and have a remainder of 5. So 964 ÷ 7 = 137 remainder 5 We write this with an 'r' for 'remainder', so it looks like this: 964 ÷ 7 = 137    r 5 Whack and zap mad professors and aliens! Make sure your maths skills add up.

113,4,"Treatment of disease was a hit-or-miss affair in Medieval Europe. You might get offered a hot bath to balance your 'natural heat', a prayer said over your bad tooth, or a leech clamped to your skin. , and knowledge was in short supply. Nevertheless, doctors were learning to be more observant of people's symptoms - the first step to treating sickness. Many Medieval doctors carried with them a (meaning 'Go-with-me') book of diagnoses and a . Usually, they examined the colour, smell and taste of the patient's urine, and made an on-the-spot guess as to what they might be suffering from. Pictures from the time make it clear that doctors also did clinical observation, and took their patient's pulse. . Since they believed that bad smells carried disease, they believed that they could protect themselves from catching the disease by carrying something nice-smelling. Since they still believed in the theory of the Four bodily fluids - yellow bile, black bile, blood and phlegm - used in ancient times to analyse and describe people's state of health. , many of their cures involved balancing the 'humours overflowing'. They did this by bleeding, applying leeches, or causing purging or vomiting in their patients. Other ways of balancing the 'natural heat' included the taking of hot baths, drinking a soup of yellow lentils, or applying water cooled with snow. Medieval apothecary brewing one of his medicines The Medieval English poet Chaucer describes how a doctor was followed by a 'tribe' of apothecaries (medicine-makers), and it is known that medieval doctors had access to a huge range of and substances. These included red rose ground fine with 'bamboo juice' for smallpox, and fig poultices for plague sores. throughout the period. Monarchs thought that by touching patients suffering from the 'King's Evil' (scrofula) they could cure them. Peasants prayed to St Roch to cure their toothache or the plague, or turned to St Anthony to cure them of 'St Anthony's Fire' (ergotism). During the time of the plague, huge Christian processions were held, at which people flagellated (whipped) themselves, to try to show God how sorry they were for their sins. Source A - Johannes de Mirfield on a medicinal bath Mirfield, a monk and a doctor, was regarded as one of the best doctors of his time. Here is a bath which has proved to be of value. Take blind puppies, gut them, and cut off the feet; then boil in water, and in this water let the patient bathe himself. Let him get in the bath for four hours after he has eaten, and whilst in the bath he should keep his head covered, and his chest completely covered with the skin of a goat, so he won't catch a sudden chill. Johannes de Mirfield, 'Flowers of Bartholomew' (c.1375) Source B - Guy de Chauliac on reducing swelling Bleeding and purging, cordials and medicinal powders can be used. The swellings should be softened with figs and cooked onions, peeled and mixed with yeast and butter, then lanced and treated like ulcers. Source C - John of Gaddesden on toothache John of Gaddesden claimed to be an expert doctor, but most of his cures relied on 'sympathetic' magic, and he clearly knew little about surgery. When the gospel for Sunday is read during the service of the Mass, let the man hearing Mass sign his tooth and his head with the sign of the Holy Cross and say the Lord's Prayer. It will keep him from pain and cure the tooth, so say trustworthy doctors. What can the sources tell historians about the treatment of disease in Medieval times? There is evidence of a belief in the curative powers of: the balancing of 'natural heat' (Mirfield's medicinal bath) all manner of natural substances (figs, blind puppies) Note that Gaddesden accepts the authority of other 'trustworthy' doctors.

115,2,"Each week until Election Day, Grade 4 will take a look at where the two candidates for president stand on important , or problems facing the country. This week's issue is the President Bush went to war in Iraq because, he said, the country's dictator, Saddam Hussein, had harmful, illegal weapons. Bush claimed that Iraq and its weapons threatened the United States and other nations. Bush says that the world is safer now that Saddam has been removed from power. His goal is to rebuild Iraq with its own government and establish peace there. Senator Kerry supported a law that allowed the United States to go to war in Iraq. Since then, he has criticized Bush's handling of the war. Kerry said that Bush misled the nation by claiming that Iraq had harmful, illegal weapons. To date, none have been found. Kerry wants to persuade other countries to help rebuild Iraq and ""win the peace."" All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation. "
116,4,"A stationary object remains stationary if the sum of the forces acting upon it - resultant force - is zero. A moving object with a zero resultant force keeps moving at the same speed and in the same direction. If the resultant force acting on an object is not zero, a stationary object begins to accelerate in the same direction as the force. A moving object speeds up, slows down or changes direction. Acceleration depends on the force applied to an object and the object's mass. You should be able to use the idea of the resultant force on an object to determine its movement. An object may have several different forces acting on it, which can have different strengths and directions. But they can be added together to give the . This is a single force that has the same effect on the object as all the individual forces acting together. When all the forces are balanced, the resultant force is zero. In this case: a moving object keeps on moving at the same speed in the same direction For example, in the diagram of the weightlifter, the resultant force on the bar is zero, so the bar does not move. Its weight acting downwards is balanced by the upward force provided by the weightlifter. The longer the arrow, the bigger the force. In this diagram, the arrows are the same length, so we know they are the same size. When all the forces are not balanced, the resultant force is not zero. In this case: A stationary object begins to move in the direction of the resultant force. A moving object speeds up, slows down or changes direction depending on the direction of the resultant force. In this diagram of the weightlifter, the resultant force on the bar is not zero. The upwards force is bigger than the downwards force. The resultant force acts in the upwards direction, so the bar moves upwards. In this next diagram of the weightlifter, the resultant force on the bar is also not zero. This time, the upwards force is smaller than the downwards force. The resultant force acts in the downwards direction, so the bar moves downwards. You should know that objects accelerate when the resultant force is not zero, and understand the factors that affect the size of the The rate of change of velocity, measured in metres per second squared. Acceleration = change of velocity ÷ time taken. An object will accelerate in the direction of the resultant force. The bigger the force, the greater the acceleration. Doubling the size of the (resultant) force doubles the acceleration. An object will accelerate in the direction of the resultant force. A force on a large mass will accelerate it less than the same force on a smaller mass. You should know the equation that shows the relationship between resultant force, mass and acceleration, and be able to use it. resultant force (newton, N) = mass (kg) × acceleration (m/s You can see from this equation that 1N is the force needed to give 1kg an acceleration of 1m/s For example, the force needed to accelerate a 10kg mass by 5m/s The same force could accelerate a 1kg mass by 50m/s Putting it simply, we can say that it takes more force to accelerate a larger mass. A truck has a mass of 2,000kg. The driving force created by the engine is 3,000 newtons. Calculate the acceleration caused by this force. Work out the answer and write it down.

Here are four typical forces on which you could be asked questions: When an object moves through the air, the force of A force of friction produced when an object moves through the air. acts in the opposite direction to the motion. Air resistance depends on the shape of the object and its speed. This happens when two objects are pushed together. They exert equal and opposite forces on each other. The contact force from the ground pushes up on your feet even as you stand still. This is the force you feel in your feet. You feel the ground pushing back against your weight pushing down. This is the force that resists movement between two surfaces which are in contact. This is the force that pulls objects towards the Earth. We call the force of gravity on an object its weight. The Earth pulls with a force of about 10 newtons on every kilogram of mass. Look at the animation of the parachutist falling at a steady speed.

118,0,"A fisherman in Japan recently spotted a rare shark. Staff at a nearby marine park discovered that it was a frilled shark. They caught the shark and took it to the park. The staff filmed it swimming and opening its jaws. Frilled sharks are sometimes caught in fishing nets, but they are rarely seen alive. That is because their natural home is between 2,000 and 3,000 feet underwater, in the twilight zone. The shark died a few hours after it was caught. Scientists believe it came close to the surface of the ocean because it was sick. All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation. "

However, they have not been able to produce silk as strong as a spider’s silk. Now some scientists say they have figured out the secret to making strong silk. what his team learned. He said that a spider’s body has a little sac where it stores tiny blobs of silk in water. When the spider releases water, the blobs turn into a gel. The spider squeezes the gel from its body, and the silk hardens. Scientists are now using what they learned to make a strong silk. They believe the silk will help people in many ways. It may be used for making clothes that protect police officers and soldiers. Scientists say the silk may also be used to repair bones and ligaments in people’s bodies. A is strong tissue that holds bones in place. Besides silk, what other things in nature are useful to people? How are they useful? Kaplan is very excited about his work.

121,2,"By Jeff Ives and Lisa M. Guidone Republicans and Democrats compete for control of Congress. The countdown to Election Day has begun. On November 7, Americans will head to the polls to vote in the Midterm elections happen in the middle of a president’s term in office. (Voters choose a president every four years. The next presidential election is in 2008.) Members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate meet in the Capitol in what is called a joint session. Midterm elections give voters a chance to choose people to represent their state in Members of Congress make up the U.S. Congress, the legislative branch of government, makes our nation’s laws. On Election Day, candidates will compete for 33 of 100 seats in the Senate and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives. Elections for governors will also be held in 36 states. Members of Congress typically belong to one of the two main in the United States: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. A political party is a group of people who have the same ideas about government goals. This election will decide whether the Democratic Party or the Republican Party controls Congress for the next two years. Republicans currently have control of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Republicans have had the upper hand in the House since 1994. Republicans have also controlled the Senate for most of the past 12 years. A party controls the House of Representatives or the Senate when its members win a or more than half, of the seats in it. (See .) Why is control of Congress so important? The party in power can more easily accomplish its goals and shape U.S. law. For months, representatives from both political parties have tried to win over voters. Their members have been speaking about important issues, or problems, our country faces. Some of those issues are the war in Iraq, gas prices, and health care. (See ""Our country is facing some serious challenges here and around the world,"" Howard Dean, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told ""At home, our economy has made it harder and harder for working people to make ends meet."" He added that ""the war in Iraq and emerging threats from other nations present new challenges to our national security."" ""Our top priority is to ensure that we continue to keep Americans safe while spreading freedom and democracy abroad,"" Ken Mehlman, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, told ""Republicans will also work to keep taxes and healthcare prices low so that families have more money to spend on things that are important to them."" Which party will come out on top in this election? It’s up to the voters to decide. Here are some key issues on voters’ minds this election season. Recent polls show that Americans’ support for the war in Iraq has dropped. President George W. Bush and many Republicans say the war is an important part of making the United States safer. Many Democrats say it’s time to rethink U.S. strategy in Iraq. Gas prices have been high for the last year. Only recently have they begun to dip. Many voters are worried about the high cost of gas. They want to hear plans for making gas more affordable. About 45 million Americans don’t have health insurance. If they get sick, it will be difficult for them to pay for medical care and drugs on their own. Voters are looking for ways in which the government can make health care more affordable.

122,2,"Keeping the Peace in No Man's Land Recently, soldiers from North Korea and South Korea marched into a no man's land. The area is between the two countries. The soldiers cleared land mines from the area. In the future, roads and railroads might be built there. The roads would link the two countries for the first time in almost 50 years. The no man's land was set up after fighting in the Korean War ended in 1953. It is a zone (DMZ). The DMZ is not under anyone's military control. ""Today we are standing at the start of a new era during which the South and the North will move forward hand in hand toward the future,"" said a South Korean official as the search for land mines started. ""We are burying a history marked by the scars of war and the pain of division."" After World War II ended in 1945, Korea was divided into two countries-North Korea and South Korea. On June 25, 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea. Sixteen countries including the United States sent soldiers to help South Korea. All 16 countries were members of the United Nations. China and the Soviet Union helped the North Koreans. About 2 million died in the war. Many of the casualties were civilians. More than 107,230 U.S. soldiers were killed. Most of the fighting ended when an armistice, or agreement to stop fighting, was signed on July 27, 1953. Land mines were placed in the DMZ to keep the two sides from combat. However, the two sides never signed a peace treaty. The two sides continued to fight occasionally. Now the countries are trying to settle their differences and work together. measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc. All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.

127,2,"If you listen to music, you are probably like millions of other kids--you turn up the volume when you hear your favorite song. Listening to loud music may be fun, but a government study shows it may also be dangerous. According to the study, which was paid for by the U.S. government, more than 5 million kids, ages 6 to 19, have suffered some hearing loss. That's more than one out of every ten kids. Out of the kids with hearing loss, more than 250,000 have moderate to severe hearing loss. Amanda Niskar, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, conducted the study. She was surprised by the results. ""It was assumed in the past that children wouldn't have noise-induced hearing loss at an early stage,"" Niskar said. Niskar blames the hearing problems on loud noises. Loud noises are a ""problem for children,"" she said. Loud music, fireworks, emergency sirens, and construction noise can all cause hearing problems. Hearing loss affects kids for the rest of their lives. In addition, not being able to hear well can cause kids all kinds of other problems. For example, hearing loss ""can influence [a] child's ability to learn in the classroom,"" Niskar said. If a child cannot hear the teacher or classmates well, he or she might have a hard time understanding lessons and following instructions. Niskar said the best way to prevent hearing loss is either to stay away from loud noises or to wear hearing protection, such as earplugs and protective headphones. So the next time you want to pump up the volume, turn it down instead. Listen Up! This diagram shows the parts of your ear. Loud noises can damage the cochlea and cause hearing loss.

Ostriches are the world's biggest birds. They have plump, round bodies covered with feathers, and long, skinny necks covered with soft fluff. Male ostriches weigh up to 350 pounds and can grow up to 8 feet tall. That's a foot taller than basketball player Shaquille O'Neal! Ostriches don't fly. Instead, they use their wings to attract mates, alert other ostriches to danger, and keep their balance. Being stuck on the ground doesn't slow ostriches down, though. They can run as fast as a car can travel--up to 50 miles an hour for about 30 minutes. At the farm in South Africa, the ostriches roam an area of flat land almost the size of 200 football fields. The workers at the farm take care of the ostrich eggs--the biggest of all bird eggs. At almost 3 pounds, each egg is about the size of a football. Even though an ostrich egg looks fragile, it is very strong. You could put a 300-pound weight on the egg without cracking its shell.

They discovered swords, spears, jewelry, and other artifacts. This copper brooch belonged to one of the Vikings. , or dug up, after a metal detector user discovered two copper brooches in the ground. The worker informed archaeologists, who believe the site dates back to the 10th century. It is one of only a few Viking cemeteries found in England. The Vikings were pirates and warriors, known for their sea faring voyages. From the late 700s to 1100, the Vikings lived in Scandinavia. That region of Europe includes the present-day countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Viking sailors spread fear throughout Europe. They raided and conquered coastal villages in Europe and along the Mediterranean coast. During their raids, Vikings captured slaves. They also , or stole, treasures, such as silver and gold. For their voyages, Viking sailors crafted swift, narrow that could navigate the stormiest seas. The Vikings were the master shipbuilders of their time. Vikings also worked as farmers and craftspeople. Others hunted and fished. The Vikings' claim to fame may have been their fearsome raids, but they were explorers and traders too. They were among the earliest explorers to travel across the Atlantic Ocean to North America. The Vikings traveled to other parts of Europe, the Mediterranean, Greenland, and North America. One of the most famous Vikings was explorer Leif Eriksson. He reached North America almost 500 years before Columbus arrived in 1492. Longships varied in size, but many were between 60 feet and 90 feet in length. A larger ship could carry about 50 raiders at a time. Strong winds allowed a longship, which had one large sail, to reach speeds of up to 17 miles an hour. Vikings used multiple oars to row the ship when there was no wind. The front end of a longship curved upward and was adorned with a wood carving of a snake's or a dragon's head. Over time, the Viking raiders lost their power as people learned to defend against their attacks. Today, the remains of Viking villages can be found throughout Europe and North America. Archaeologists plan to study the burial ground in England to learn more about the life of the Vikings. Based on the objects found, they believe the site was once a Viking settlement. Vikings were known to bury valuable items with the dead. As one historian put it, the site will allow experts to ""uncover the secrets of a time capsule more than 1,000 years old.""

131,4,"Before 1700, the open-field system of agriculture had been in place for centuries. However, by 1750, the British population was growing rapidly and this meant agriculture had to change. In 1750 almost 50 per cent of farms in Britain were using the open-field system to grow crops. This was a system that had and had always sufficiently fed the British population. Local landowners rented land to tenant farmers who grew just enough food to survive and, if there was any food left over, they would then sell it at the village market. This system was known as Under the open-field system, a typical village would have three or sometimes four fields around it and a piece of common land that everyone could use. Each villager had in each field, which meant everyone had a piece of good land and a piece of bad land. Each field was planted with a different crop every year. One might have wheat, a second barley and the last field lay fallow (empty) to allow the soil to recover its goodness, otherwise the soil's nutrients would be used up and produce a bad crop. Diagram of the open-field system showing a village with three fields: During winter, animals could graze on the fallow field so that manure would act as a fertiliser. Villagers needed to have land in all three fields because of the rotation cycle; otherwise they would have had no crops every third year. This system had been in use for centuries and it had many advantages, but by 1750, and the system's disadvantages became much greater than its advantages. Advantages and disadvantages of the open-field system It met the country's need for food for many centuries. Land was wasted annually by the fallow field because one third of the land went unused. Land was wasted with pathways that separated farmer's strips in the fields. There were no fences, so animals sometimes wandered around crushing crops. Decisions were made by a majority vote, so villagers enjoyed a sense of influence. People worked together and shared tools, tasks and expenses. Villagers could not choose what crops to plant. Time was wasted walking between the different strips of land. Poor villagers could use the common land for crops or to graze cattle. The common land helped to create a feeling of community in the village. Common land could be used for growing more crops, but it was wasted. If a neighbour was lazy, then weeds might appear in other people's crops. The system provided security - villagers always had someone to rely on for help and a sense of structure. Having strips of land and sharing tools meant that it was hard to try new techniques. to approximately 22 million people. Industrial towns and factories had started to develop very quickly and could no longer grow their own food and needed to be fed. Meanwhile, made it possible to deliver food from the more isolated country farms more quickly to towns. British agriculture was about to change. To help you remember the information in this Revision Bite, go through the information and identify as many reasons as you can about why British farming needed to change after 1800. The population was growing so there were more people who all needed to be fed, so more food needed to be produced. Towns were growing up, and the people who lived in towns did not produce their own food, so the rural areas had to produce enough food to feed them. Land was being wasted with walkways and fallow fields. New techniques could not be used under the open-field system. As part of your revision, think about the the open-field system had outlived its usefulness by 1790. the key features of agriculture and rural society were in 1750. the open-field system had not changed since the Middle Ages. the open-field system was so good for villagers.

134,4,"Vegetable oils are obtained from plants. They are important ingredients in many foods, and can be hardened through a chemical process to make, for example, margarine. They can also be used as fuels, for example as biodiesel. Food additives are chemicals added by food manufacturers to certain foods, including vegetable oils, to improve their shelf-life, taste and appearance. Vegetable oils are natural oils found in seeds, nuts and some fruit. to squeeze the oil out. Olive oil is obtained this way. Sometimes the oil is more difficult to extract and has to be . Once the oil is dissolved, the solvent is removed by distillation, and impurities such as water are also removed, to leave pure vegetable oil. Sunflower oil is obtained in this way. . Glycerol has three carbon atoms and fatty acids have long chains of carbon atoms. In the diagram below you can see how three long chains of carbon atoms are attached to a glycerol molecule, with its three carbon atoms. Together they combine to make one molecule of vegetable oil. The structure of a vegetable oil molecule The long fatty acid chains stop vegetable oils dissolving in water. The fatty acids in some vegetable oils are , and only have single bonds between their carbon atoms. Saturated oils tend to be , and are sometimes called vegetable fats instead of oils. Lard is an example of a saturated oil. The fatty acids in some vegetable oils are , and have double bonds between some of their carbon atoms. Unsaturated oils tend to be , and are useful for frying food. They can be divided into two categories: Unsaturated vegetable oils tend to be liquid at room temperature, but they can also be 'hardened', through a chemical process called hydrogenation, to make them solid at room temperature. The carbon-carbon double bonds in unsaturated oils can be detected using the elements bromine or iodine. These elements react with the double bonds in the oils, and the more double bonds there are, the more bromine or iodine is used up. You can check for unsaturated fats using a simple test with bromine water. The test is similar to one used to differentiate alkenes from alkanes. Bromine water is a dilute solution of bromine, which is normally orange-brown in colour. It becomes colourless when shaken with an alkene, or with unsaturated fats. When shaken with alkanes or saturated fats, its colour remains the same. Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment. For information on how to enable JavaScript please go to the You will not be able to see this content until you have JavaScript switched on. During hydrogenation, vegetable oils are hardened by reacting them with hydrogen gas at about 60ºC. A nickel catalyst is used to speed up the reaction. The double bonds are converted to single bonds by the hydrogenation. In this way unsaturated fats can be made into saturated fats. The structure of part of a fatty acid Saturated vegetable oils are solid at room temperature, and have a higher melting point than unsaturated oils. This makes them suitable for making margarine, or for commercial use in the making of cakes and pastry. Vegetable oils in food, fuel and emulsions and trans fats Vegetable oils are important nutrients and provide a lot of energy. You must be careful not to eat excessive amounts to avoid becoming overweight. Vegetable oils are also used as fuels for vehicles. Some of this is made from waste cooking oil and rapeseed oil. Such fuels are , which means that they release only as much carbon dioxide when they burn as was used to make the original oil by photosynthesis is the process where green plants use water and carbon dioxide and sunlight to produce carbohydrates (stored energy) and release oxygen (as a by-product). . This helps to reduce global warming. However, some people are concerned about whether it is ethical to use food crops in this way, instead of using them to feed hungry people. Vegetable oils do not dissolve in water. If a mixture of oil and water is shaken, then left to stand, eventually a layer of oil will form on the surface of the water. If an emulsifier is added to the oil and water, a mixture called an emulsion forms. Emulsions are more viscous than oil or water on their own, and contain tiny droplets of one of the liquids spread through the other liquid. from 2006 about trans fats in food. . These are thought to cause health problems such as heart disease in humans, and food manufacturers are being encouraged to reduce the amount of them in our food. As we have seen, processed foods, including vegetable oils, may have chemicals added to them. These chemical additives have different jobs, including extending a food product’s shelf life and improving its taste and appearance. You can find additives listed on the ingredients label of such foods, and many of these additives have orange colouring for soft drinks, sweets and sauces allows oil and water mix to make margarine, ice cream and salad cream used in many foods to stop harmful micro-organisms growing Additives with an E number have been licensed by the European Union. Some are natural and some are artificial, but they have all been tested for safety and passed for use. The UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) has strict limits on the amount of colourings allowed in food. Some additives can lead people to have allergic reactions to them, and colourings are banned from use in baby foods. A red dye called 'Sudan I' was quite recently banned for use in food, because it was thought to be a health risk. Some of the dye had been used in chilli powder before the ban came into force, and was later added in this form to some foods by mistake. Hundreds of food items with this ingredient had to be taken off supermarket shelves and destroyed as a result. "

The sea lions sleep in the sun, bark loudly, and eat fish. (They don't always smell that great, however!) Animal experts are not sure why sea lions first came to Pier 39. But the number of sea lions has grown each year since an earthquake hit San Francisco in 1989. Before the earthquake, only about 30 sea lions camped out at Pier 39. Now, the number of sea lions can be as high as 600! Food to Eat and Room to Spread Out Experts say the earthquake might have caused , a type of fish, to swim closer to San Francisco than before. Herring is a favorite food of sea lions, so they might have followed those fish to shore. Sea lions might also like the pier because they have plenty of room to spread out. The Marine Mammal Center, an organization that cares for sea animals, asked the city to protect the sea lions. Now the sea lions cannot be moved from the pier. Sea lions can grow to be up to 8 feet long and weigh up to 850 pounds. Sea lions can swim up to 20 miles per hour. Sea lions usually live between 20 and 30 years.

140,3,"Acids, bases and metals - Naming salts Acids, bases and metals - Naming salts A salt is always made when an acid is neutralised by a base. But the exact salt made depends upon which acid and base were used. The name of a salt has two parts: the first part comes from the metal in the base used the second part comes from the acid that was used Where does the name potassium nitrate come from? These are the rules for the second part of the name of a salt: How can we make copper sulfate? The first part of the name is 'copper', so we need a base containing copper. We could use copper oxide or copper carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'sulfate', so we need to use sulfuric acid. Here are word equations for those reactions. copper sulfate + water + carbon dioixde How can we make sodium chloride? The first part of the name is 'sodium', so we need a base containing sodium. We could use sodium hydroxide or sodium hydrogen carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'chloride', so we need to use hydrochloric acid. Here are word equations for those reactions. sodium chloride + water + carbon dioxide It would be very difficult to neutralise the acid in these reactions perfectly exactly. Some acid or base would be left over. So it would not be safe to taste the sodium chloride solution produced. Whack and zap mad professors and aliens! More than 3000 video clips from BBC programmes.

If a solution is neither acidic nor alkaline we call it . Pure water is neutral, and so is paraffin. Indicators are substances that change colour when they are added to acidic or alkaline solutions. You can prepare homemade indicators from red cabbage or beetroot juice - these will help you see if a solution is acidic or alkaline.

Litmus indicator solution turns red in acidic solutions and blue in alkaline solutions - and it turns purple in neutral solutions. is usually more reliable, and comes as red litmus paper and blue litmus paper. The table shows the colour changes it can make. Notice how we say 'stays red'. This is better than saying 'nothing' or 'stayed the same', because it tells us the colour we actually see. Universal indicator is a mixture of several different indicators. Unlike litmus, universal indicator can show us how strongly acidic or alkaline a solution is. This is measured using the pH scale. The pH scale runs from pH 0 to pH 14. Universal indicator has many different colour changes, from red for strong acids to dark purple for strong bases. In the middle, neutral pH 7 is indicated by green. Universal indicator shows how acidic or alkaline a solution is These are the important points about the pH scale: acidic solutions have pH values less than 7 alkaline solutions have pH values more than 7 the closer to pH 0 you go, the more strongly acidic a solution is the closer to pH 14 you go, the more strongly alkaline a solution is Whack and zap mad professors and aliens!

The minor planet Ceres is found here, too. Asteroids can crash into each other. When they do, they can break apart and change orbit. The orbits of some asteroids cross the Earth’s orbit. At various times during the Earth’s history, asteroids have hit it. A tremendous amount of energy was released, throwing up billions of tonnes of dust and hot rocks. Together with smoke from widespread fires, this blocked heat and light from the Sun. It changed the Earth’s climate, making it very cold. It is thought that an asteroid colliding with the Earth helped to drive the dinosaurs to extinction. Scientists worry that an asteroid could hit again and cause a global catastrophe.

153,4,"Between now and the exam, you need a clear idea of how to practise and improve. Some tried and tested strategies follow - decide which ones will work best for you. The more you practise them, the more you are likely to remember to use them during the exam itself. Build up your personal vocabulary - learn a small number of new words every day Make sure you are familiar with the different types of task you may be asked to do, such as: answering questions non-verbally (usually by means of a letter - A, B, C, etc.) selecting from more than one option (usually 3 suggested answers) matching a word on the tape to a picture or icon filling in a form or grid (with a single word) filling in a form or grid (with a phrase that might include a verb) completing a statement or sentence (from suggested options) identifying time frames (past, present or future) working out opinions, feelings, attitudes or reasons deciding whether an opinion is positive, negative or positive and negative deciding whether a statement is correct or not and giving a reason summarising what people are saying (from suggested options) deducing or making conclusions by means of suggested alternatives working out the correct order or sequence of events or activities Be careful! Sometimes there will be words on the tape, or words and pictures in the question that could distract you from the right answer! For example, if you hear: ‘ Me gusta la natación pero prefiero el ciclismo ’ (I like swimming but I prefer cycling), and the question asks ‘What sport does the person prefer?' - you might see icons for swimming, basketball and cycling. If you were tempted to choose the icon for swimming as your answer, you would probably have misunderstood the phrases ‘ Ask your teacher for recordings to take home. In the exam you will only hear each item or part of an item twice, but by listening to recordings at home beforehand, you'll build your confidence and train your ear. you listen to the tape, it could help your confidence when you realise how much you understand. Try not to write when the tape is playing - it is hard to write and listen at the same time - trust your short-term memory! If you are entered for the Higher tier, take every opportunity to listen to longer passages. Focus on the feelings, opinions and attitudes of the speakers. Before you go into the exam, ask your teacher to offer the class a 'warm up' listening session of about 20 minutes - or just listen to a tape of your own. You need to go to the exam with strategies that will help you work well under pressure. Here are some suggestions: You are usually given 5 minutes to read through the paper before the tape starts. Use this to your advantage by looking right through the paper so see what kind of tasks there are. Look closely! Should you listen for precise information (like train arrival and departure times)? Or should you be listening to the whole passage, in order to draw a conclusion (for example, name the girl who has the best relationship with her parents)? As you read the question, try to predict the sort of information that may be in the passage. It will help focus your mind. Look at the title of the question or section very carefully. Make sure you understand to give your answer. If there is an example, look closely at the answer given - it will show you whether you need to write a single letter, a single word, or more than one word. Have a good look at any illustrations. They could give important clues as to what is coming. word - there is probably a lot of 'redundant' language you don't need. Be positive. Concentrate on what you do understand. Sometimes the passage can be difficult, but the questions are easy. Use your knowledge of grammar. For example, it may be important to know whether someone is talking about the past, the present, or the future. Use your knowledge of Spanish-speaking countries. For example, if you hear someone was on holiday in Madrid, it is unlikely they spent time on the beach. Don't just listen to the words. The tone of someone's voice may also be helpful - for example in telling you if they are making a statement or asking a question. If you have to write answers in Spanish, remember you will not be penalised for minor spelling mistakes. "

This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame. That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best. Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers. Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds! How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy. A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.) So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.) is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking. Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans. So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Turn the page to find out! Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824! In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president. Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt. By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen. The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll. A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be . That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another. Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the , or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand. It's as Easy as One, Two, Three So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it. The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper: As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer? Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers. Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds! The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people. We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart. Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?

Now they may have found the answer hidden in an ancient staircase. They found the staircase in Dos Pilas, Guatemala. Dos Pilas was an ancient Maya city. Winds from a hurricane uncovered the staircase. Scientists studied carvings on the steps. The carvings are called , which are a kind of picture writing. Scientists translated the hieroglyphs. The writing shows that the Maya disappeared after a brutal war. During the long war, the people living in two Maya cities fought one another. The people of Tikal, in Guatemala, battled the people of Calakmul, in Mexico. The rulers of each city wanted to control the entire area. Dos Pilas was located south of both cities. Dos Pilas had been founded by the ruler of Tikal as a military outpost. The brother of Tikal's ruler ran the outpost. At one point in the war, Calakmul took control of Dos Pilas. Calakmul's warriors spared the life of the ruler of Dos Pilas, so he changed sides. He attacked and defeated his brother in Tikal. ""This was not part of a struggle between two brothers, but part of a world war,"" said historian Arthur A. Demarest. After Dos Pilas defeated Tikal, the brutal war between Tikal and Calakmul got worse. Eventually Tikal regained its former strength and ""roared back and crushed Calakmul,"" Demarest said.

Each year, the Great Insect Fair is held in State College, Pennsylvania. Thousands of people attend the fair to look at bugs, touch bugs, and even eat bugs. Dorothy Blair is a nutrition expert. She says the fair teaches visitors that insects are an important source of food for people in some other countries. Visitors to the fair can munch on stir-fried mealworms, cooked wax moth larvae, and chocolate-covered crickets, which are called Chocolate Chirpies. ""Last year, we ran out of Chocolate Chirpies. We had to make about 6,000 of them this year,"" Blair said. Many of the fair's visitors are kids. Emily Paulson, age 7, played with a millipede at the fair. The large bug crawled up her arm. She said, ""It's sort of like a comb crawling up your arm. It was neat!"" All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation. "
165,4,"'Percent' means 'out of 100'. If 90 per cent of the population owns a mobile phone, this means 90 out of every 100 people have one. The symbol '%' means per cent. A percentage is a fraction of 100. (30 in each 100) as a fraction is Often, in real life - and maths exams - you must find a percentage of a quantity. First, write the percentage as a fraction or a decimal, then multiply by the quantity. First, write 40% as a fraction: 40% = Practise converting percentages to fractions.

The original price was £75, but there is a discount of 30%. How much will the discount be? (Note that if the question asked for the discount price, you would subtract the discount from the original price : £75 - £22.50 = £52.50.) Sometimes both the percentage and amount of money will not be whole numbers. A car costs £9,999.90 before VAT (value added tax). Work out the cost of the VAT if it is charged at 17.5%. Since the answer is a price, it must be rounded to two decimal places. People often buy something at one price, and sell it on for another - eg, when they are selling things at a car boot sale. If the selling price is greater than the buying price, a If the selling price is less than the buying price, there is a People pay tax on the income they earn. The basic rate of income tax is 22%. Value Added Tax is added to the cost of most things you buy. It is charged at 17.5%. In some questions you are given the cost price and the selling prices and have to find the percentage increase or decrease. This means you need to find one amount as a percentage of another. You form a fraction from the two amounts and multiply this by 100. Try these questions. Ajay is dealing in electrical goods. He buys a radio for £45 and sells it for £63. What is his percentage profit? Here the cost price is £45 and the selling price £63. The profit is £63 - £45 = £18 To calculate the percentage profit you have to find what the profit is as a percentage of the original price. So divide the profit by the original price and multiply by 100. Charlotte buys a coat in a sale for £60. The original cost of the coat was £80. What is the percentage decrease? The coat was bought for £60, and the original price was £80. The decrease is £80 - £60 = £20. To calculate the percentage decrease, divide the actual decrease by the original price and multiply by 100. Sometimes a question will ask you to work and find the original price after an increase. In Question 1 you were told the original price (the cost price) and the selling price. You were asked to find the percentage profit. Instead imagine you were given the selling price (£63) and the percentage profit (40%), and told to find the original price. to find 40% of £63 and take it away. The 40% is a percentage of the original price, not of the selling price. (40% of £63 happens to be £25.20 which is no help at all.) The method for questions like this is in . If you are given a quantity a percentage increase or decrease, and you need to find the original amount, use this method. "

170,3,"Diet, drugs and health - Digestion and enzymes Diet, drugs and health - Digestion and enzymes Our teeth break food down into small pieces when we chew. This is only a start to the process of digestion, as chewed pieces of food are still too large to be absorbed by the body. Food has to be broken down chemically into really small particles before it can be absorbed. Enzymes are needed so that this break-down happens quickly enough to be useful. Take care - enzymes are not living things. They are just special proteins that can break large molecules into small molecules. Different types of enzymes can break down different nutrients: . Carbohydrase enzymes break down starch into sugars. The saliva in your mouth contains amylase, which is another starch digesting enzyme. If you chew a piece of bread for long enough, the starch it contains is digested to sugar, and it begins to taste sweet. . Protease enzymes break down proteins into amino acids. Digestion of proteins in the stomach is helped by , which is strong hydrochloric acid. This also kills harmful micro-organisms that may be in the food. Lipase enzymes break down fat into fatty acids and glycerol. Digestion of fat in the , made in the liver.

176,4,"Forensic scientists analyse substances from a crime scene using many methods - including checking for traces of metals that might indicate a link between significant people or objects in the case. Individual transition metals can be identified by the colour of their precipitate with sodium hydroxide solution. Flame tests can be used to identify a particular metal. Transition metals form coloured compounds with other elements. Many of these are soluble in water, forming coloured solutions. If sodium hydroxide solution is then added, a transition metal hydroxide is formed. These are insoluble. They do not dissolve but instead form solid precipitates. Here are the equations for copper sulphate solution reacting with sodium hydroxide solution: copper sulphate + sodium hydroxide    →    copper hydroxide + sodium sulphate     +     2NaOH        →        Cu(OH) (blue solution + colourless solution → blue precipitate + colourless solution) Copper solutions form a blue precipitate with sodium hydroxide Different transition metals form different coloured precipitates. Some common transition metals and the colours of their precipitates. green - turns orange-brown when left standing How could you tell if an unknown substance contained iron(II) nitrate or iron(III) nitrate? You would add a few drops of sodium hydroxide solution. If you got a dark green precipitate it would show that the unknown substance was iron(II) nitrate; if you got an orange-brown precipitate it would show that the unknown substance was iron(III) nitrate. Note that it is the metal that determines the colour. So you would get the same result whether you used zinc chloride or zinc nitrate - a white precipitate in this example.

177,1,"After years of protection, bald eagles and other endangered animals are making a comeback. The future looks bright for some endangered animals! Thanks to tough laws and hardworking scientists, many of these animals are doing well. The bald eagle is one success story. The bird became the symbol of the United States in 1782. At that time, about 100,000 bald eagles lived in the lower 48 states. By 1963, only 417 nesting pairs remained. Hunting and loss of habitat contributed to the or drop in number. However, the biggest threat came from DDT, a chemical used for farming. DDT made the birds’ eggshells so thin that chicks couldn’t survive. or not allowed. In 1973, the Endangered Species Act was created. That law protects threatened plants and animals. Bald eagles soon gained protection under this law. Today, there are more than 7,100 bald eagle nesting pairs in the lower 48 states. Plans are under way to take the birds off the endangered species list. If that happens, they will still be protected by other U.S. laws. ""It is a good endangered species success story,"" spokesperson Nicholas Throckmorton of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told ""Caring citizens have brought our national symbol back from the brink of extinction."" The bald eagle isn’t the only endangered species doing well. Here are some other success stories. in and around Yellowstone National Park were endangered as a result of hunting and habitat loss. By 1975, only 220 to 320 bears lived in Yellowstone. Today, there are more than 600. Scientists counted only 67 nesting females in 1973.

178,4,"Greek knowledge about the body and disease Greek knowledge about the body and disease Man's body has blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile. These make up his body and through them he feels illness or enjoys health. When all the humours are properly balanced and mingled, he feels the most perfect health. Illness occurs when one of the humours is in excess, or is reduced in amount, or is entirely missing from the body. Hippocrates, 'On the Constitution of Man' (c.500BC) Hippocrates was a real doctor, but most of the books ascribed to him were written by his disciples. (To help you remember the four humours, along with blood and phlegm, think of yellow bile as vomit, and black bile as diarrhoea.) I shall describe what the plague was like ... At the beginning the doctors were unable to treat the disease because of their ignorance of the right methods. Equally useless were prayers in the temples, consulting the oracles and suchlike. Thucydides, 'History of the Peloponnesian War' (c.500BC) Silenus had become overtired from drinking and exercising at the wrong time and had caught a fever. He began with pains in the stomach, heavy head and a stiff neck. 1st day: he vomited, his urine was black, he was thirsty, tongue dry, no sleep at night. 6th day: slight perspiration about the head, head and feet cold and black, no discharge from the bowel, no urine, acute fever. 8th day: cold sweat all over, red rashes, severe diarrhoea, urine bitter and passed painfully, hands and feet cold. 11th day: he died breathing slow and heavy, stomach throbbing. He was about 20 years old.' Once you have read the sources about Greek physiology, look for evidence that the Greeks: believed in the theory of the 'four humours' did not think the gods caused disease believed that an imbalance of the humours caused disease studied the 'natural history' of different diseases wrote down what they knew in order to pass on their knowledge believed in the theory of the 'four humours' 'blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile ... make up his body.'

Here are the teacher's comments. The teacher is looking for answers that make sense and give all the information asked for, with some development of tasks to reach the required word limit. Correct use of tenses is important as well. Firstly, Lára is writing a postcard, so she needs to lay it out properly. She did this - giving an address, an opening and a closing statement. She then goes about fulfilling the main tasks, developing answers where appropriate. Tá mé féin go maith mar tá mé ar laethanta saoire sa Spáinn. Tá mé anseo le mo theaghlach. She says she travelled by plane and added a nice sentence saying why she enjoyed this - she had never been on a plane before. "" Bhí sé ar fheabhas mar ní raibh mé ar eitleán riamh. Lára tells us she is staying in a hotel by the sea - "" Tá muid ag stopadh in óstán cois farraige. "" She develops this task by telling us more about the hotel. This is a good idea. "" Tá an seomra measartha beag ach tá sé glan agus compordach. Tá linn snámha taobh amuigh den óstán ."" She uses the present tense correctly as well.. Lára also correctly uses the plural form "" "" (We are). She mentioned that she is on holiday with her family, it is more natural to use this plural form - We are staying / We came on the plane etc. Mention two things you have done so far Chuaigh muid ag snámh san fharraige maidin inné agus chuaigh muid amach go dtí bialann aréir - fuair muid béile iontach deas.

Ach tá mé ceart go leor anois. Eoghan uses the past tense correctly to say how he travelled and he develops the task to say that the journey was too long and he was ill - this shows very good use of language. Tá an aimsir ar fheabhas - bíonn an ghrian ag soilsiú gach lá - ach bíonn sé róthe in amanna. Eoghan uses the present tense correctly to talk about the weather. He uses some nice phrases to describe weather. Try to develop your answers like this - a general statement about the weather and then something more specific - eg. sun shining every day / it's too hot. Is breá liom an áit mar tá neart le déanamh ag daoine óga. Tá na daoine iontach cairdiúil agus tá an bia blasta fosta. Eoghan gives some excellent reasons why he likes the place in which he is staying and again uses the present tense. Beidh mé anseo ar feadh cúpla lá eile. Feicfidh mé thú ag an dioscó oíche Aoine. The future tense is used here to make an arrangement to meet up later. Eoghan ends his postcard with an appropriate phrase - / all the best. There are many different ways of signing off eg. Le grá / Slán go fóill / Slán / Ádh mór - all of these add a bit of style to your writing. This is an excellent piece of writing at this level. Sentences are accurate and easy to understand. It has answered the question in full and covered all five tasks asked for. There is evidence of development of tasks - extra information added when appropriate. It has only gone slightly over the word limit. The correct tenses are used and a good range of vocabulary included. "
181,3,"The beginning of a text is crucial to its success. If the start is weak, there is a risk that the reader will lose interest and stop reading it. Here is the opening paragraph of a text about boxing: Boxing, amongst other hand-to-hand fighting, has been with us for thousands of years. Originally it was nothing more than bare fist fighting between two willing, and sometimes unwilling, competitors for the entertainment of others. Some people argue that it is a relatively safe, disciplined, highly skilled and technical sport that brings enjoyment and employment to a great many people. Others claim that it is a dangerous and barbaric spectacle that has no place in the civilised world. This article will explore each side's claim in more detail. Why is this an effective opening for the text? It is totally in keeping with the title. It uses a formal, impersonal tone, which is appropriate for an argument text. It gives a summary of both sides of the argument. Let's consider some alternative beginnings and see if they are suitable. Decide what you think of each one and then read our comments below. This article will talk about the damage that can be inflicted when two men stand face-to-face with the sole intention of knocking each other out with their fists. It will go on to argue that boxing, or legitimate assault, has no place in the twenty first century. This extract certainly gets straight to the point. Although this beginning is quite formal, it is certainly not impersonal as the writer lets the reader know exactly what they think about boxing. The reader can be sure about what the answer to the question in the title will be from the first sentence. The bell goes and the two warriors approach each other. They are quick. They are strong. They are hard. They are ready to hurt and be hurt. A left fist launches and connects with a nose. The crowd are on their feet. Cheering. Wanting more. Wanting blood. This is prose rather than a non-fictional argument. It uses descriptive and figurative language. It could be the opening of a short story or a novel. What do you need to construct a text? Love books?

182,2,"Preserving the Past: Saving the Mummies of the Ibaloi High up in a dense, lush bamboo forest in the Philippines, scientists hike up a steep and narrow trail. (The Philippines is an island country in South-east Asia.) As the scientists climb higher, they watch out for mud slides and rock falls. Finally, they emerge from under the forest's dripping leaves to face a forbidding black rock. As their eyes adjust to the light, they can see a small, narrow cave near the base of the rock. Inside that cave, and numerous other nearby caves, is a national treasure. The treasure is not made of gold and silver, however, but of flesh and bone. The treasure is actually dozens of mummies, some as old as 1,000 years. The Ibaloi people placed the mummies in the caves. The mummies are the remains of some of the Ibaloi leaders and their families. The descendants of the mummies still live in the Philippines. The mummies are located in an area called Kabayan in the Cordillera Central mountains. As many as 200 mummies may be located in 50 caves in the mountainous area. The mummies are important because they tell scientists about past life in the Philippines. The mummies are also , which means they are important to the religion of the Ibaloi. Scientists from the National Museum of Manila in the Philippines are scrambling to find and protect all the mummies. The scientists worry that logging, forest fires, farming, or vandals may damage the mummies. To protect the mummies, the Philippine government is putting up gates in front of the caves. Guards and tour guides are being hired to show people the mummies and to keep vandals away. According to museum scientists, it took as much as one year to prepare an Ibaloi mummy. The process started when an Ibaloi tribal leader or family member who was near death drank a very salty liquid called . The brine helped preserve the body. The body was then strapped to a chair and placed over a low fire, as well as left in the sun to dry, for up to one year. Over time, the body would shrink. The body was then folded and placed in a coffin carved from a pine tree. All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation. "
183,3,"Ducklings are able to walk almost immediately after hatching from the egg, and can even swim after a few days. They recognise their mother because of a behaviour type called Ducklings will follow the first moving object they meet after hatching. They become socially attached to this object and treat it as their mother. Imprinting lets young animals recognise their mother from a young age. They can follow her for food and protection. Imprinting is useful if the first moving object they see really is their mother. But ducklings will imprint on people, balls and even cardboard boxes if these happen to be the first things they see. Geese, chicks, and other baby birds that can walk around shortly after hatching, also show imprinting behaviour. Konrad Lorenz (1903 to 1989) was an Austrian scientist who studied animal behaviour. He discovered that if he reared geese from when they hatched, they became imprinted on him. They followed him around and preferred to be near him even when they had grown into adult geese. Lorenz won the 1973 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine because of his experiments on animal behaviour. Is it instinct or conditioning that makes you study science?

184,4,"Cells depend on the body environment to live and function. Homeostasis keeps the body environment under control and keeps the conditions right for cells to live and function. Without the right body conditions, certain processes (eg osmosis) and proteins (eg enzymes) will not function properly. Living cells depend on the movement of chemicals around the body. Chemicals such as oxygen, carbon dioxide and dissolved food need to be transported into and out of cells. This is done by the processes of diffusion and osmosis, and these processes depend on the body's water and salt balance, which are maintained by homeostasis. Cells depend on enzymes to speed up the many chemical reactions that keep the cell alive and make it do its job. These enzymes work best at particular temperatures, and so again homeostasis is vital to cells as it maintains a constant body temperature. Particles in liquids and gases move about randomly in all directions. In an area of high concentration, particles will escape from the concentrated area to places where there are fewer or no particles. Very few particles leave an area of low concentration to go to an area where the concentration is higher. is the movement of particles from an area of concentration.

In the lungs, the blood will continue to take in oxygen from the alveolar air spaces, provided there is more oxygen in the air spaces than in the blood. The oxygen diffuses across the alveolar walls into the blood. The circulation takes the oxygen-rich blood away and replaces it with blood that is low in oxygen.

In the exam, you may be asked to give two examples of diffusion in organisms. Make sure you know an example from plants as well as from animals. Some membranes in plant and animal cells allow certain particles to pass through them but not others. They are During osmosis, more water molecules pass from the pure water into the dilute solution than pass back the other way. This is because there is a higher concentration of water molecules in the pure water than in the solution. This results in more water molecules diffusing across the concentration gradient from the water to the solution. Eventually, the level on the more concentrated side of the membrane will rise, while that on the less concentrated side falls. . This is still like diffusion, as the water is moving from a higher concentration of water to a lower concentration of water. Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

When the concentration of water is the on both sides of the membrane, the movement of water will be the same in both directions. At this point, the net exchange of water is zero, and the system is in If red blood cells are placed in pure water, water enters them by osmosis and the red blood cells swell up and burst. If cells are placed in a concentrated solution, water leaves them by osmosis and they are unable to function. . This is why homeostasis is important - to keep our body temperature at a As the temperature increases, so does the rate of chemical reaction. This is because heat energy causes more collisions, with more energy, between the enzyme molecules and other molecules. However, if the temperature gets too high, the enzyme is A common error in exams is to write that enzymes are killed at high temperatures. Since enzymes are not living things, they Graph showing the effect of temperature on enzyme reactions Enzymes are specific. Only molecules with the can fit into the enzyme.

Anything that changes the shape of the active site stops the enzyme from working. This is similar to a key that opens a door lock. It does not matter what a key handle looks like, but if you change the shape of the ‘teeth’ the key no longer works. The shape of the active site is affected by . This is why enzymes will only work at a specific pH, as well as a specific . Change the pH and the enzyme stops working.

We say they have become Active transport is the process by which dissolved molecules move across a cell from a lower to a higher concentration. In active transport, particles move the concentration gradient - and therefore require an input of Sometimes dissolved molecules are at a higher concentration inside the cell than outside, but, because the organism needs these molecules, they still have to be absorbed.

185,4,"Getting the best out of your training requires a little planning. The best training programmes are built on principles of specificity, overload, progression and reversibility. You can also use the FITT acronym to help remember the key things to consider when tailoring programmes for individual sporting goals. It stands for; Frequency, Intensity, Time and Type. Calculating the target zone also helps assess how much aerobic or anaerobic training you need to do to improve fitness. Just don’t forget to warm down! Training should be matched to an individual's needs By using the principles of training as a framework we can plan a personal that uses scientific principles to improve performance, skill, game ability and physical fitness. which are personal fitness needs based on age, gender, fitness level and the sport for which we are training. A successful training programme will also include exercise in the correct The key principles when planning a programme are: – training must be matched to the needs of the sporting activity to improve fitness in the body parts the sport uses. - fitness can only be improved by training more than you normally do. You must work hard. – start slowly and gradually increase the amount of exercise and keep overloading. – any adaptation that takes place as a result of training will be reversed when you stop training. If you take a break or don’t train often enough you will lose fitness. If you are studying the AQA specification this is known as 'duration'. - decide which methods of training to use. You should also consider the principle of . It is important to have rest periods which allow the body to adapt. Too much training (overtraining) can lead to injury.

Aerobic training improves Relating to the heart and the blood vessels. exercise is performed in short, fast bursts where the heart cannot supply enough oxygen to the muscles. Anaerobic training improves the ability of the muscles to work without enough oxygen when lactic acid is produced. Specific training methods can be used to improve each fitness factor. Weight training improves muscular strength, endurance and power involves performing a series of exercises in a special order called a circuit. Each activity takes place at a 'station'. It can be designed to improve speed, agility, coordination, balance and muscular endurance. involves working for a sustained period of time without rest. It improves cardio-vascular fitness. involves using another sport or activity to improve your fitness. It happens when an athlete trains in a different environment. For example a volleyball player uses the power training for that sport to help with fitness for long jump. or 'speed play' training involves varying your speed and the type of terrain over which you run, walk, cycle or ski.

190,2,"Dodging Danger: Should Dodgeball Be Tossed Out of School? For many kids, dodgeball is a harmless game. But gym teacher Neil Williams does not see anything ""harmless"" about the game. Recently, Williams recalled an accident that happened during his first year teaching. His students were playing dodgeball. Suddenly, the ball slammed into one girl's face, smashing her nose. The girl had to be taken to the hospital. Soon after that, Williams started a campaign to ban dodgeball from schools. Some schools in several states have already banned the game. The object of dodgeball is to get other players out by hitting them with a ball. Critics of the game say that it teaches violence. ""The game allows the stronger kids to pick on and target the weaker kids,"" Williams told Judith Young is the executive director of the National Association for Sport and Physical Education. She told the game doesn't belong in school. ""I don't have a problem with the game at backyard picnics and parties,"" she said. ""I just don't think it should be used in phys-ed classes."" Rick Hanetho strongly disagrees. He likes dodgeball so much that he started the National Amateur Dodgeball Association. Hanetho says dodgeball teaches kids important skills. ""It teaches eye-hand coordination, decision making, concentration, and agility,"" he said. Hanetho also says that dodgeball does not encourage bullying. ""I don't buy the idea that dodgeball allows some kids to pick on the smaller and weaker kids,"" he said. ""In fact, it's the littler kids who are usually the best players. They are faster and can avoid being hit."" Here's what some kids have to say about dodgeball: Isabela, age 11: A dodgeball isn't hard and it can't hurt anyone. Paloma, age 9: I like dodgeball. You get to run around a lot and that's a lot of fun. Liliam, age 9: Dodgeball is great because you get to throw the ball at other kids. Mara: age 10: Some kids don't like dodgeball because they get hit at the beginning of the game. But I like it. measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.

192,4,"Work done and energy transferred are measured in joules (J). The work done on an object can be calculated if the force and distance moved are known. A change in momentum happens when a force is applied to an object that is moving or is able to move. The total momentum in an explosion or collision stays the same. You should know, and be able to use, the relationship between work done, force applied and distance moved. Work and energy are measured in the same unit, the joule (J). When an object is moved by a force, energy is transferred and work is done. But work is not a form of energy - it is one of the ways in which energy can be transferred. This equation shows the relationship between work done, force applied and distance moved: work done (joule, J) = force (newton, N) × distance (metre, m) The distance involved is the distance moved in the direction of the applied force. A force of 10N is applied to a box to move it 2m along the floor. What is the work done on the box? The work done is 10 × 2 = 20J. Check your understanding of this by having a go at the activity.

Any object that is raised against the force of gravity stores . For example, if you lift a book up onto a shelf, you have to do work against the force of gravity. The book has gained gravitational potential energy. Elastic objects such as elastic bands and squash balls can change their shape. They can be stretched or squashed, but energy is needed to change their shape. This energy is stored in the stretched or squashed object as (sometimes called movement energy). The more mass an object has, and the faster it is moving, the more kinetic energy it has. You should be able to discuss the transformation of kinetic energy to other forms of energy. Several energy transfers happen when a squash ball is dropped onto a table and bounces up again. When the ball is stationary above the table, its gravitational potential energy (GPE) is at a maximum. It has no kinetic energy (KE), or elastic potential energy (EPE). As the ball falls, its GPE is transferred to KE and the ball accelerates towards the table. When the ball hits the table, the KE is transferred to EPE as the ball squashes. As the ball regains its shape, the EPE is transferred to KE and it bounces upwards. When the ball reaches the top of its travel, all the KE has been transferred to GPE again. Note that the ball will be lower than it was when it was first dropped, because some energy is also transferred as heat and sound to the surroundings. The pendulum is a simple machine for transferring gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy, and back again. When the bob is at the highest point of its swing, it has no kinetic energy, but its gravitational potential energy is at a maximum. As the bob swings downwards, gravitational potential energy is transferred to kinetic energy, and the bob accelerates. At the bottom of its swing, the bob’s kinetic energy is at a maximum and its gravitational potential energy is at a minimum. As the bob swings upwards, its kinetic energy is transferred to gravitational potential energy again. At the top of its swing, it once again has no kinetic energy, but its gravitational potential energy is at a maximum. Note that the bob’s swing will become lower with each swing, because some energy is also transferred as heat to the surroundings. Here is a version of the 'Work and Energy' podcast with drawings to help explain things. In order to see this content you need to have both . This is the tendency of the object to keep moving in the same direction. It is difficult to change the direction of movement of an object with a lot of momentum. You can calculate momentum using this equation: momentum (kg m/s) = mass (kg) × velocity (m/s) magnitude - an amount because it depends on the object’s mass direction - because it depends on the velocity of the object What is the momentum of a 5 kg object moving at 2 m/s? So long as no external forces are acting on the objects involved, the total momentum stays the same in explosions and collisions. We say that momentum is conserved. You can use this idea to work out the mass, velocity or momentum of an object in an explosion or collision. A bullet with a mass of 0.03 kg leaves a gun at 1000 m/s. If the gun’s mass is 1.5 kg, what is the velocity of the recoil on the gun? momentum of bullet = mass × velocity Rearrange the equation: velocity = momentum ÷ mass velocity of recoil on gun = 30 kg m/s ÷ 1.5 kg When there is a car crash, the car, its contents, and the passengers, decelerate rapidly. They experience great forces because of the change in momentum, which can cause injury. If the time taken for the change in momentum on the body is increased, the forces on the body are reduced too. Seat belts and crumple zones are designed to reduce the forces on the body if there is a collision. Seat belts stop you tumbling around inside the car if there is a collision. However, they are designed to stretch a bit in a collision. This increases the time taken for the body’s momentum to reach zero, so reduces the forces on it. Air bags increase the time taken for the head’s momentum to reach zero, so reduce the forces on it. They also act a soft cushion and prevent cuts. Crumple zones are another safety feature in cars You should know, and be able to use, the relationship between kinetic energy, mass and speed. This equation shows the relationship between kinetic energy (J), mass (kg) and speed (m/s): What is the kinetic energy of a 1,000kg car travelling at 10m/s? × 1,000 × 100 = 50,000J (or 50kJ) Check your understanding of this section by having a go at the activity.

For information on how to enable JavaScript please go to the You will not be able to see this content until you have JavaScript switched on. You need to be able to calculate the force involved in changing the momentum of an object. Here is the equation you need: The force is measured in newtons, N. The time is measured in seconds, s. A 25 kg bicycle is travelling at 12 m/s. What force is needed to bring it to a halt in 5 s? Momentum at start = 25 × 12 = 300 kg m/s Momentum at end = 0 × 12 = 0 kg m/s Change in momentum = 300 - 0 kg m/s So a force of 60N is needed. You should see that, for a given change in momentum, the longer the time taken, the smaller the force needed. This is the idea behind many car safety features. It also explains why it takes a long time to stop a super-tanker at sea, or to change its direction.

201,4,"Electric motors transfer electrical energy into kinetic energy, using magnets and coils of wire. There is a relationship between electrical power, voltage and current (power = voltage × current). Whenever useful energy is transferred, some energy that is not useful is also transferred – we say such energy is 'wasted'. When you measure the efficiency of a device, you measure how much of the energy supplied is useful. The cost of electricity depends upon the amount of electrical power used, the amount of time it is used for, and the charge made for each unit of electricity. It is possible to reduce heat losses from homes using insulation, and this saves money, but some methods of insulation are more cost-effective than others. If you are given information such as a diagram, you should be able to explain how an electric motor works. A simple electric motor can be built using a coil of wire that is free to rotate between two opposite magnetic poles. When an electric current flows through the coil, the coil experiences a force and moves. The direction of the current must be reversed every half turn, otherwise the coil comes to a halt again. This is achieved using a conducting ring split in two, called a . A coil of wire is used with lots of turns to increase the effect of the magnetic field. The animation shows a simple electric motor, with the arrow heads showing the direction of the current. Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

You should be able to recall and apply: the relationship between charge, current and time the relationship between energy transferred, voltage and charge Electrical charge is measured in coulomb ( ). The amount of electrical charge that moves in a circuit depends on the current flow and how long it flows for. The equation below shows the relationship between charge, current and time: charge (coulomb, C) = current (ampere, A) × time (second, s) For a given amount of electrical charge that moves, the amount of energy transferred increases as the voltage increases. The equation below shows the relationship between energy transferred, voltage and charge: energy transferred (joule, J) = potential difference (volt, V) × charge (coulomb, C) Check your understanding of the relationship between charge, current and time by having a go at this activity.

You should know that energy can be 'wasted' during energy transfers, and you should be able to calculate the The fraction of the energy supplied to a device which is transferred in a useful form. Energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be transferred from one form to another, or moved. Energy that is 'wasted', like the heat energy from an electric lamp, does not disappear. Instead, it is transferred into the surroundings, and spreads out so much that it becomes very difficult to do anything useful with it. Ordinary electric lamps contain a thin metal filament that glows when electricity passes through it. However, most of the electrical energy is transferred as heat energy instead of light energy. Below is the Sankey diagram for a typical filament lamp. Modern energy-saving lamps work in a different way. They transfer a greater proportion of electrical energy as light energy. Below is the Sankey diagram for a typical energy-saving lamp. Sankey diagram for a typical energy-saving lamp From the diagram, you can see that much less electrical energy is transferred, or 'wasted', as heat energy. The efficiency of a device such as a lamp can be calculated using this equation: efficiency = (useful output ÷ total input ) × 100 The efficiency of the filament lamp is (10 ÷ 100) × 100 = 10%. This means that 10% of the electrical energy supplied is transferred as light energy (90% is transferred as heat energy). The efficiency of the energy-saving lamp is (75 ÷ 100) × 100 = 75%. This means that 75% of the electrical energy supplied is transferred as light energy (25% is transferred as heat energy). Note that the efficiency of a device will always be less than 100%. The amount of electrical energy transferred to an appliance depends on its power, and on the length of time it is switched on for. The amount of mains electrical energy transferred is measured in kilowatt-hours ( The equation below shows the relationship between energy transferred, power and time: energy transferred (kilowatt-hour, kWh) = power (kilowatt, kW) × time (hour, h) Note that power is measured in kilowatts here, instead of the more usual watts. To convert from W to kW you must divide by 1,000. For example, 2,000W = 2,000 ÷ 1,000 = 2kW. Also note that time is measured in hours here, instead of the more usual seconds. To convert from seconds to hours you must divide by 3,600. For example, 1,800s = 1,800 ÷ 3,600 = 0.5 hours. Electricity meters measure the number of units of electricity used in a home or other building. The more units used, the greater the cost. The cost of the electricity used is calculated using this equation: cost = power (kW) × time (hour) × cost of 1 kWh (pence) An electric fire needs 2 kW. It is switched on for 3 hours. If each kWh costs 10p, how much does it cost to run the fire? cost = power × time × cost of 1 kWh        = 2 kW × 3 h × 10p A TV needs 250 W. It is switched on for 30 minutes. If each kWh costs 8p, how much does it cost to run the TV? cost = power × time × cost of 1 kWh        = 0.250 W × 0.5 h × 8p Electricity can be used to heat homes and offices. If some of the heat escapes from the house, it costs money and wastes resources. There are several ways that heat can escape from a house, and different ways to reduce these losses. In deciding how cost-effective an energy-saving measure is, we need to know what its payback time is: payback time = cost of energy-saving measure ÷ money saved each year Double-glazing might cost £2,500 and save £100 a year. What is the payback time? payback time = cost of energy-saving measure ÷ money saved each year Take a look at this image showing heat loss from a house. red shows where most heat is lost - through the windows and roof windows - fit double glazing and curtains gaps around the door - fit draught excluders the walls - fit cavity wall insulation Heat energy is transferred from homes by The transfer of heat energy through a material - without the material itself moving. through the walls, floor, roof and windows. It is also transferred from homes by The transfer of heat energy through a moving liquid or gas. . For example, cold air can enter a house through gaps in doors and windows, and convection currents can transfer heat energy in the loft to the roof tiles. Heat energy also leaves the house by radiation through the walls, roof and windows. There are some simple ways to reduce heat loss, including fitting carpets, curtains and draught excluders. Heat loss through windows can be reduced by using double glazing. There can be either air or a A volume that contains no matter - space is almost a vacuum. between the two panes of glass. Air is a poor conductor of heat, while a vacuum can only transfer heat energy by radiation. Heat loss through walls can be reduced using cavity wall insulation. This involves blowing insulating material into the gap between the brick and the inside wall, which reduces the heat loss by conduction. The material also prevents air circulating inside the cavity, therefore reducing heat loss by convection. Heat loss through the roof can be reduced by laying loft insulation. This works in a similar way to cavity wall insulation. from 2006 about energy efficiency in homes. "

204,4,"Often, when chemicals are mixed together they react too slowly for the synthesis to be economic, or too quickly for the reaction to be safe. The rate of synthesis reactions needs to be controlled so that the product is produced as quickly (therefore cheaply) and safely as possible. In the exam you will be expected to give examples of reactions with different rates and to explain how the rate of a reaction could be measured. . Reactions that happen slowly have a rate of reaction and reactions that happen quickly have a rate of reaction. For example, the chemical of rocks is a very slow reaction: it has a rate of reaction. Explosions are very fast reactions: they have a The rate of a reaction can be measured by either: substances present at the start of a chemical reaction A product is a substance formed in a chemical reaction. The formation of product or consumption of reactant could be measured by observing a change of colour or the formation of a precipitate. Sometimes it is easier to measure the change in the amount of a reactant that has been used up, and sometimes it is easier to measure the change in the amount of a product that has been produced. The measurement itself depends upon the nature of the reactant or product: The mass of a substance (solid, liquid or gas) is measured with a balance. The volume of a gas is usually measured with a gas syringe, or sometimes with an upside down measuring cylinder or burette. It is usual to record the mass or total volume at regular intervals and to plot a In the exam you will need to know the factors that affect the rate of reactions, and how to plot or interpret graphs from rate experiments. The above graph summarises the differences in the rate of reaction at different temperatures, concentrations and size of solid pieces. The steeper the line, the greater the rate of reaction. Reactions are usually fastest at the beginning, when the concentration of reactants is greatest. When the line becomes horizontal, the reaction has stopped. the rate of a reaction without being in the chemical changes that take place. The addition of a catalyst often allows a reaction to take place quickly at a Read on if you are taking the In a chemical reaction, the reactant particles can only react with each other when they bump into one another. According to bonds between their atoms can break, and then new bonds can form to make new molecules. The molecules in gases and liquids are moving constantly, and millions of collisions take place every second. But only a small number of these collisions lead to the formation of product. For a collision to be ‘successful’, the particles involved must possess enough energy, called the , to break some of the existing bonds. Any change that increases the number of collisions per second, or increases the energy of the particles that are colliding, will If the temperature is increased, there will be more energy in the collisions. More collisions will have the activation energy, resulting in an increase in the rate of reaction. If the concentration of one or more of the reactants is increased, there will be more collisions per second, resulting in an increase in the rate of reaction. "

Many Jews hope to have Look up at the heavens and count the stars - if indeed you can count them…. So shall your offspring be. Judaism teaches that the purpose for sex is not just to have children: it is also for married people to demonstrate their love for each other. Marriage sanctifies the relationship between men and women: The mating of animals is a temporary and purely physical act. Through the sanctification of marriage, a husband and wife become Once people are married, sex is controlled by the laws of (sexual purity). Women cannot have sex during their monthly menstrual period. After this is over she has a ritual bath (called a ) then she can sleep with her husband again.

This attitude is also supported by the way in which people understand the reason for the destruction of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah: The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. 'My lords,' he said, 'Please turn aside to your servant’s house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning.' 'No,' they answered. 'We will spend the night in the square.' But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate. Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom - both young and old - surrounded the house. They called to Lot, 'Where are the men who came to you tonight?

The helicopters safely or moved, the animals to trucks for a six-hour drive. So far, more than 90 moose have been brought to Grand Mesa, Colorado, that way. The idea for the project began six years ago when a Colorado man thought of bringing moose to Grand Mesa for the first time. ""There was a big meadow full of willows, and it looked like there should be a moose standing there,"" Roger Shenkel told Shenkel shared his idea with officials at the Colorado Division of Wildlife (DOW). The DOW spent years studying Grand Mesa's habitat. A habitat is the place where an animal or a plant naturally lives. When officials decided that the area was suitable for moose, the DOW workers set out to find some of the animals to live there. Utah needed more bighorn sheep because their numbers have dropped. In or trade, for the moose, Colorado sent about 20 bighorn sheep to Utah in February. ""Here in northern Utah, we have too many moose,"" Justin Dolling of the Utah DOW told can be a big problem.

216,4,"Plants can make identical copies of themselves by asexual reproduction, for example by tubers and runners. Humans have been cloning plants for years and have recently started to develop techniques to clone animals. However, animal cloning raises ethical issues about how far humans should interfere in the production of new life. Plants can make identical copies (clones) of themselves. Many plants have ways of increasing their numbers by asexual reproduction – new plants are created by repeated cell division: Strawberry plant with runners - stems growing sideways , each of which can grow into a new plant. Strawberry plants and spider plants produce long stems with tiny plants on the end. These can produce several new plants from one parent. It's fairly easy to artificially produce new plants by taking a cutting, and waiting for the cutting to develop new roots and leaves. Cutting being dipped in hormone rooting powder before planting How to clone cows using embryo transplants This technique could be used to make many copies of cows that have a high milk yield. It would produce a herd of cows much faster than if the original cow was used for breeding in the normal way. Sexual reproduction is still involved and the calves are not identical to either parent. for use in human transplant surgery. The pigs would first have human genes inserted into their cells so that the organs would not be rejected when into a human. Inserting human genes into a pig is very difficult. Once it has been done successfully the pig would be so that many copies of the organ could be grown. All the new plants are genetically identical – they will all have the desired characteristics. Organisms that are difficult or slow to breed normally can be reproduced quickly. Some plant varieties do not produce seeds, others have seeds that are dormant for long periods. If a clone is susceptible to disease or changes in environment, then all the clones will be susceptible. It will lead to less variation, and less opportunity to create new varieties in the future. How Dolly the sheep was cloned - higher The cloning process of 'Dolly the sheep' In this famous example of cloning, an ordinary cell was used to replace the nucleus of an egg cell, so all of Dolly’s cells had identical DNA to the one parent that donated the cell. This form of cloning produced a single genetically identical offspring. about how far humans should be allowed to interfere in the production of new life. Regulations currently . Cloning expensive food crops has been carried out for many years, and causes the public fewer ethical and moral concerns than animal cloning.

One such satellite is the TERRA satellite, operated by the USA, Canada and Japan. The satellite orbits just 700km above the ground, and takes about two hours to complete each orbit of 45 000km. That’s more than ten times faster than the fastest commercial airliner on Earth. There are several cameras on board to record the Earth. One of these cameras records radiation in three different parts of the visible and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, shown as blue bands in the diagram: The information from the different ranges of wavelength recorded by the cameras are transmitted to Earth as digital signals, using . The microwave beam spreads out a little when it leaves the satellite aerial just as all waves do when they go through a gap, but the digital signal reaching the Earth still contains all the information. The signals for different wavelengths are combined together to give the beautiful images that we are used to seeing from satellites. The colours in these images are not true colours, as the wavelengths being combined are not the ones to which our eyes are sensitive, but they show all the detail needed to look at the use of land, the effect of global warming on sea levels and temperatures, the amount of cloud cover and its effect on weather. Calculate the speed in km/hour of the satellite in its orbit. The diagram shows three regions of the electromagnetic spectrum: ultraviolet, visible light and infrared. Which of these three regions has photons of the greatest energy? Which of these three regions of the electromagnetic spectrum has the highest frequency? One other region of the electromagnetic spectrum, apart from ultraviolet, visible light and infrared, is named in the article. The diagram below shows a fuller view of the electromagnetic spectrum. The blue bands show the three regions of the spectrum recorded by the camera in the satellite. Label the region you have named in question 4. The article describes waves spreading out when they go through a gap. What is the name for this spreading? Satellite images produced by this camera make good use of colour, including blue and violet. Explain how you can tell, from the diagrams of the spectrum, that these colours were not present in the original image. Read this aditional information and answer the questions below. Visible light recorded by the satellite cameras is sunlight that has been reflected by the land, sea or clouds. Long wavelength infrared is given off by warm objects. This version of the spectrum in the article has two of the wavelength bands recorded by the camera labelled A and B. Explain how the amount of regions A and B recorded by the camera for the same part of the Earth would change over 24 hours. Explain how the amount of regions A and B recorded by the camera would compare, on the same day in March, between an African country and a snowy northern country such as Canada. The fastest commercial aircraft (no longer flying) was the Concorde, which went at 2180 km/hour. Show that the satellite is moving more than ten times as fast as this, as the article states.

A dust storm forms when high winds pick up sand and blow it across the surface. Large dust storms can last for months and blanket the entire planet with the red dust. Two dry riverbeds cut across the surface of Mars. Each riverbed is more than a half-mile deep. Scientists say the riverbeds formed when water suddenly gushed to the surface from inside Mars. The riverbeds might have formed billions of years ago, scientists say. Hundreds of dry riverbeds crisscross the Red Planet. Valles Marineris is the largest canyon on Mars. It is nearly 2,500 miles long and about 4 miles deep. On Earth, it would almost span the distance between New York City and Los Angeles. (The Grand Canyon on Earth is only 227 miles long and 1 mile deep!) The volcanoes on Mars are larger than volcanoes on Earth. The largest Martian volcano, is about the same size as Arizona at its base. Mars has ice caps at its north and south poles, much like Earth has. But Martian ice caps are made of water ice and frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice. The polar ice caps grow in the winter and shrink in the summer. This photo shows the planet's south pole in summer. One day on Mars is 24 hours long; one year is 687 days long. Temperatures on Mars range from -220 degrees Fahrenheit (F) to 68 degrees F. Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos. A person who weighs 50 pounds on Earth would weigh 19 pounds on Mars. measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc. All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation. "

223,4,"Light and sound travel as waves. There are two types of wave - transverse and longitudinal. Waves can be described by their amplitude, wavelength and frequency. The speed of a wave can be calculated from its frequency and wavelength. from place to place without matter (solid, liquid or gas) being transferred. Think of a Mexican wave in a football crowd. The wave moves around the stadium, while each spectator stays in their seat only moving up then down when it's their turn. Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

The substance is known as the , and it can be solid, liquid or gas. Sound waves and seismic waves are like this. They must travel through a medium. It is the medium that vibrates as the waves travel through. Other waves do not need to travel through a substance. They may be able to travel through a medium, but they do not have to. Visible light, infrared rays, microwaves and other types of electromagnetic radiation are like this. They can travel through empty space. Electrical or magnetic fields vibrate as the waves travel through. You should be able to describe the characteristics of Light and other types of electromagnetic radiation are transverse waves.

You should understand what is meant by the amplitude, wavelength and frequency of a wave. As waves travel, they set up patterns of disturbance. The amplitude of a wave is its maximum disturbance from its undisturbed position. Take care: the amplitude is the distance between the top and bottom of a wave. It is the distance from the middle to the top. The wavelength of a wave is the distance between a point on one wave and the same point on the next wave. It is often easiest to measure this from the crest of one wave to the crest of the next wave, but it doesn't matter where as long as it is the same point in each wave. The frequency of a wave is the number of waves produced by a source each second. It is also the number of waves that pass a certain point each second. The unit of frequency is the hertz (Hz). It is common for kilohertz (kHz), megahertz (MHz) and gigahertz (GHz) to be used when waves have very high frequencies. For example, most people cannot hear a high-pitched sound above 20kHz, radio stations broadcast radio waves with frequencies of about 100MHz, while most wireless computer networks operate at 2.4GHz.

You should know and be able to use the relationship between wave speed, frequency and wavelength. The speed of a wave - its wave speed (metres per second, m/s)- is related to its frequency (hertz, Hz) and wavelength (metre, m), according to this equation: For example, a wave with a frequency of 100Hz and a wavelength of 2m travels at 100 x 2 = 200m/s. The speed of a wave does not usually depend on its frequency or its amplitude. Check your understanding of the equation by having a go at this activity.

There are four vessels in his nostrils, two give mucus and two give blood. There are four vessels in the forehead which then give blood to the eyes; all diseases of the eyes arise through them. There are four vessels to the head which produce a bald spot and loss of hair. The breath which enters into the nose enters into the heart and the lung; these join to the whole belly.

232,4,"Conditions in the body are controlled, to provide a constant internal environment. This is called homeostasis. The conditions that must be controlled include body temperature, water content, carbon dioxide level, and blood sugar level. Hormones are chemicals secreted by glands. They travel through the bloodstream and affect target organs. Sexual development, the menstrual cycle and fertility in women, and blood sugar levels, are all controlled by hormones. It is important that the body’s internal environment is controlled. For example, the amount of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream is carefully controlled. Maintaining a constant internal environment is called are responsible for this. Here are some of the other internal conditions that are controlled: This is controlled to provide cells with a constant supply of energy. The blood sugar level is controlled by the release and storage of glucose, which is in turn controlled by a hormone called This is controlled to maintain the temperature at which enzymes work best, which is 37°C. Body temperature is controlled by: This is controlled to protect cells by stopping too much water from entering or leaving them.

Human enzymes usually work best at 37ºC, which is human body temperature. This can be measured in several places, including the ear, finger, mouth and anus. There are various ways to measure body temperature, including using a clinical thermometer, heat-sensitive strips, digital probes or thermal imaging cameras. high temperatures can cause dehydration, heat stroke, and death if untreated low temperatures can cause hypothermia, and death if untreated The body’s temperature is monitored by the brain. If you are too hot or too cold, the brain sends nerve impulses to the skin, which has three ways to either increase or decrease heat loss from the body’s surface: Hairs on the skin trap more warm air if they are standing up, and less if they are lying flat. Tiny muscles in the skin can quickly pull the hairs upright to reduce heat loss, or lay them down flat to increase heat loss. If the body is too hot, glands under the skin secrete sweat onto the surface of the skin, to increase heat loss by evaporation. Sweat secretion stops when body temperature returns to normal. Blood vessels supplying blood to the skin can swell or dilate - called vasodilation. This causes more heat to be carried by the blood to the skin, where it can be lost to the air. Blood vessels can shrink down again - called vasoconstriction. This reduces heat loss through the skin once the body’s temperature has returned to normal. Muscles can also receive messages from the brain when you are cold. They respond by shivering, which warms you up. - Hair muscles pull hais on end. - Hair muscles relax. Hairs lie flat so heat can escape. - Sweat secreted by sweat glands. Cools skin by evaporation. A very common mistake in exams is to write that the blood vessels move up and down in the skin. The blood vessels do not move during vasodilation and vasoconstriction. Hormones are chemicals secreted by glands in the body. Different hormones affect different target organs. The bloodstream transports hormones from the glands to the target organs. Bodily reactions to hormones are usually slower and longer lasting than nervous reactions.

If pregnancy does not happen, the lining is shed at menstruation. oestrogen, which causes the repair of the uterus wall Both hormones are secreted by the ovaries. The image below shows how the levels of oestrogen and progesterone change during the menstrual cycle. If a woman becomes pregnant, the level of progesterone remains high. Human fertility is controlled by hormones. This means that a knowledge of hormones can be used to decide to increase, or reduce, the chances of fertilisation and pregnancy. 'The pill' is an oral contraceptive that greatly reduces the chances of mature eggs being produced. The pill contains oestrogen, or oestrogen and progesterone. These hormones prevent eggs from maturing in the ovaries. Some women have difficulty becoming pregnant because they do not produce enough of a hormone called FSH, which is needed for eggs to mature. Fertility drugs contain FSH, which stimulates eggs to mature in the ovary. "

236,4,"The nervous system allows the body to respond to changes in the environment. This is a process usually coordinated by the brain. Reflex actions are extra-rapid responses to things that set off a reaction in the nervous system - for example, light, heat, sound, gravity, smell, taste, or temperature. The singular is stimulus , and this process also involves the nervous system, but bypasses the brain. Receptors are groups of specialised cells. They can detect changes in the environment, which are called , and turn them into electrical impulses. Receptors are often located in the , such as the ear, eye and skin. Each organ has receptors sensitive to particular kinds of stimulus. The central nervous system - CNS - in humans consists of the brain and spinal cord. When a receptor is stimulated, it sends a signal along the nerve cells - neurones - to the brain. The brain then co-ordinates the response. An effector is any part of the body that produces the response. Here are some examples of effectors: a muscle contracting to move the arm a muscle squeezing saliva from the salivary gland chemical messengers produced in glands and carried by the blood to specific organs in the body Neurones are nerve cells. They carry information as tiny electrical signals.

Central Nervous System (brain and spinal cord). The diagram below shows a typical neurone - in this case, a motor neurone. It has tiny branches at each end and a long fibre carries the signals. Where two neurones meet, there is a tiny gap called a synapse. Signals cross this gap using chemicals. One neurone releases the chemical into the gap. The chemical diffuses across the gap and makes the next neurone transmit an electrical signal.

Officials from New York are turning this young conservationist's idea into a reality. A conservationist is a person who helps save wildlife and other natural resources. Blue lupine is the only food that Karner caterpillars will eat. Land development has destroyed much of their habitat. With the help of the Seneca Park Zoo in Rochester and other officials, Blake's fourth grade class and a class at another elementary school will plant seeds for a blue lupine garden near the local airport. Blake said it's important to help endangered species because ""every part of life has its place in the ecosystem.""

These are the type of questions where there is only a yes or no answer or only one possible answer: eg Are you male or female? These questions let the person answering share their thoughts and ideas more fully: eg What do you think of the new English teacher? You can show that you are listening carefully to the answer of a closed or open question, by asking another question: ""What exactly do you mean by that?"" Or by checking that you've understood correctly by repeating back to that person what you thought they meant: ""So, you're saying that you think that violence is never the right answer?"" For their Speaking and Listening assessment, Matt has been paired with Tim. Matt has to interview Tim about his favourite character in the play, Romeo and Juliet. Tim is really shy and hates speaking. To get good marks himself, Matt knows that he has to encourage Tim to speak too. Can you spot the listening skills that Matt uses to help Tim? Why do you like him better than say, one of the main characters, like Romeo? He's not so much of a show off. Do you mean he doesn't talk as much as Romeo? Yes. (Long pause) It's not just that. He's down to earth. Whereas Romeo is away with the fairies? (Laughs) Not exactly. A bit, I s'pose.

243,4,"Explain the reasons for the downfall of Terence O'Neill. Teacher's notes: This question is worth 6 marks in the exam. Give yourself 7 - 8 minutes to answer it. Mark Scheme: In History you are marked by levels. The higher the level the more marks you get and so the higher grade you will achieve. The answer will be general providing some information related to the question but it will not adequately explain the reasons for O'Neill's resignation. The answer will discuss some of the reasons for the downfall of O'Neill but lack sufficient depth. The answer will show that the candidate is aware that O'Neill had lost the support of both nationalists and unionists and it will clearly outline the reasons for this. Terence O'Neill was Prime Minister of Northern Ireland from 1963 to 1969. He led the Unionist Party during these years. He brought in many reforms which did not really satisfy nationalists who wanted major changes. There were protest marches and street violence during the years 1968 and 1969 and as a result O'Neill resigned in April 1969. Paul would get a level 1 for this answer. The candidate's answer is too general. Some reasons for O'Neill's downfall have been included but these needed to be explained more fully. Terence O'Neill was forced to resign in 1969. He had lost the support of nationalists and unionists over his government's handling of the Civil Rights Movement and the protest marches which they had organised. Although O'Neill had brought in a Five-Point Reform programme and had sought to improve relations with the Republic of Ireland, nationalists felt his reforms did not go far enough. Following some bomb explosions in 1969 he resigned. Glenn would get a level 2 for this answer. The candidate has provided an answer of reasonable quality but it lacks balance. It provides some reasons to explain why nationalists were unhappy with O'Neill's leadership but fails to explain why many unionists were also dissatisfied. Terence O'Neill resigned in April 1969 having lost the support of many nationalists and unionists. As early as 1965 Dr. Ian Paisley, following O'Neill's meetings with the Irish Taoiseach Sean Lemass, had started an ""O'Neill Must Go"" campaign. Many unionists had become increasingly unhappy with O'Neill's reforms which they saw as concessions to nationalists and they felt he was taking N. Ireland closer to a United Ireland. He had major critics, Faulkner, Craig and Chichester-Clark within his own Party, who disagreed with him over his reforms and resigned from his government. O'Neill was also heavily criticized by nationalists for his reluctance to bring in reforms such as ""One Man, One Vote"" and for his Government's handling of the civil rights marches in October 1968 and January 1969 when marchers had been attacked. His growing unpopularity was clearly revealed by the limited support shown for pro-O'Neill candidates in the February election of 1969. Following some UVF explosions at water pumping stations in the spring of 1969, O'Neill decided to resign. Nuala would get a level 3 for this answer. The candidate has produced a high quality response. It clearly outlines how O'Neill had alienated many nationalists and unionists and reveals that the campaign to oust him had started as early as 1965. It also explains how the lack of support for O'Neill had become very evident in the early months of 1969. Four audio History Lessons track the history of the Troubles from 1972-1985.

244,2,"""May I stay up just a little longer?"" That's the cry heard from kids every night in many U.S. households. That's because most kids don't want to go to bed. Instead of sleeping, many kids are watching latenight TV, playing computer games, reading, doing homework, or chatting with friends. According to a recent report, staying up late may be costing kids more than just a few winks. The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recently studied the sleeping patterns of 12- to 18-year olds. The NSF study says only 15 percent of kids get at least 8? hours of sleep per night. The NSF says kids need 9 to 11 hours of sleep each night. Jennifer McCandless, age 13, said she tries to go to bed on time each night. Jennifer explained what happens if she doesn't get enough sleep. ""I'm like a zombie-- awake, but not doing anything,"" she said. Will Wilkoff is a children's doctor and sleep expert in Maine. He said one reason kids aren't getting enough sleep is that families are busier than ever before. Families are trying ""to squeeze 28 hours of living into 24 [hours],"" Wilkoff said. In the past, most kids would go home right after school. Today, kids often have several after-school activities. When kids do get home, they have homework to do. All of this activity keeps kids from going to bed when they should. Kids who don't get enough sleep can have problems at school. The study found that kids who don't get enough sleep at night often fall asleep during the day. Sixty percent of the kids in the study said they have felt tired during the day. Twenty percent said they have even fallen asleep at school. Kids who are tired have problems remembering information. The study found that kids who don't get at least nine hours of sleep at night get lower grades than kids who get enough sleep. Wilkoff said that kids have to develop a schedule that lets them get enough sleep. ""Make those tough decisions,"" he said, ""and say, 'We're going to have to give up one or two of our activities.' "" If a kid loses one hour of sleep a night, how many hours of sleep does he or she lose in a week? A month? A year? measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.

Land mines are explosive devices left in the ground from wars.A land mine can explode if someone touches it, killing or injuring the person. Children often mistake the land mines for toys. Now Rosa's job is to teach U.S. children about the dangers of land mines so they can help fight the problem. I recently caught up with the clever canine at Paradise Valley Elementary School, located in Casper, Wyoming.I watched as Rosa did her job sniffing out some fake land mines. ""She's cool,"" gushed fifth grader Josh Yelton. Rosa's visit kicked off the Children Against Land Mines Program, also known as CHAMPS. The goal of the program is to raise money to buy, train, and transport mine-sniffing dogs.Wyoming students raised $5,000 in quarters in just a few short weeks, and adults chipped in an additional $8,000. The money will help sponsor a new dog. A dog's sense of smell and smarts make it the best land-mine locator. In fact, a team of six humans can search about 120 square feet of land in a day. A team of six dogs can search up to 3,000 square feet in a day's time. The pooch paid for by the Wyoming students will be named Wyoming. That dog will help find buried land mines in Sri Lanka, a country off the southern coast of India. Land mines not only injure and kill many people, but they also , or stop, people from moving around freely. For example, the lush fields of Sri Lanka should be filled with crops. Instead, many fields lie unplanted. Farmers are afraid that mines litter their fields. Wyoming's job will be to help get rid of those land mines. A Sri Lanka government official told me what a huge effect Wyoming and other mine-sniffing dogs will make in his country. He said, ""The best part of the CHAMPS program will be when all the land mines have been removed."" In what other ways do dogs help humans? measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.

254,4,"The atmosphere has not always been the same. It has been much the same, but nevertheless now contains more nitrogen and oxygen, and less carbon dioxide, than it did when the earth first formed. Recently, the addition of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels has lead to global warming. It is difficult to predict, even by using computer models, exactly what the mean temperature of the Earth will be in the future. However it seems sensible to limit global warming and protect the environment, through sustainable development and by reducing waste, wherever possible. Scientists believe that the Earth was formed about 4.5 billion years ago. Its early atmosphere was probably formed from the gases given out by volcanoes. It is believed that there was intense volcanic activity for the first billion years of the Earth's existence. The early atmosphere was probably mostly carbon dioxide, with little or no oxygen. There were small quantities of water vapour, ammonia and methane. As the Earth cooled down, most of the water vapour condensed and formed the oceans. So how did the proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere go down, and the proportion of oxygen go up? The proportion of oxygen went up because of photosynthesis by plants. The proportion of carbon dioxide went down because: it was locked up in sedimentary rocks, such as limestone, and in fossil fuels it was absorbed by plants for photosynthesis The burning of fossil fuels is adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere faster than it can be removed. This means that the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing. Back to Fuels, air, seawater and pollution index The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.

They also played sounds adult sandhill cranes make. So the cranes learned to trust and follow people in planes. By flying to Florida, 11 sandhill cranes were helping their cousins, the whooping cranes. Many sandhill cranes live in the United States. But few whooping cranes live here anymore. Only one group of whooping cranes knows how to , or travel, from the North to the South. Scientists hope to teach other whooping cranes to migrate. More cranes may survive if they can learn to travel back and forth. Next year, scientists will train whooping cranes to migrate the same way they trained sandhill cranes.

For example, a computer model of a school's budget might show that the school will run out of money before the end of the term if it hires an extra teacher. A spreadsheet appears as a grid, each row has its own number and each column its own letter. This labelling of rows and columns is used to give each cell a cell address or reference, for example, C5 means column C, row 5. It is also possible to refer to a range of cells collectively, ie E4:E12 includes E4, E12 and all of the cells in-between. A grocer uses a mobile shop to sell groceries to customers who live out of town. He uses a spreadsheet to keep a record of his daily sales: There are a number of formulae in the above spreadsheet but they're hidden, only the results are displayed. The formula in cells E4 to E10 works out the total value of sales for each item. It does this by multiplying the number sold by the individual price. For example, seven kilograms of apples were sold at 70p per kilogram, the sales total is calculated as £4.90 and is displayed in the cell E4. The formula in E4 is Cell E12 contains a formula that calculates the total value of the sales column. The formulae used is . This formula includes cells E4, E10 and all of the cells in-between.

At the end of July, Felix broke a world record. He became the first person to fly across the English Channel without an aircraft. The English Channel is a body of water that separates England from France. Felix began his adventure by jumping from a plane 30,000 feet above the coast of England. That is about as high as Mount Everest. Felix parachuted down until he landed in a town on the coast of France. It took him about 14 minutes to cross the Channel, flying at speeds of up to 200 miles per hour. Felix wore a special suit and had a gliding wing strapped to his back. He carried oxygen with him to help him breathe. That’s because the air that high up is very thin. Felix, who began parachuting as a teenager, referred to another piece of flying history. ""It’s [100 years ago] that the Wright brothers were doing the first flight with a plane,"" he said, ""and now I’m here, with my little wing.""

The Commissions had interviewed factory owners. They had all stated their beliefs that the , that the children were not harmed in any way by the work. But historians just decided that they were biased and telling lies – they never considered that the workers interviewed may have been the same. Some factory owners, such as Robert Owen, John Fielden, Titus Salt and John Wood were spectacularly good employers who made sure conditions were excellent in the factories, and took pains to care for the employers’ lives outside the factory. Cotton-mill owner from New Lanark in Scotland. Provided pleasant houses, schools and a co-operative shop. Had a shorter day and good wages. No child under ten was allowed to work in his mills. Set up the Grand National Consolidated Trades Union (1834) for workers. Robert Owen created a pleasant community for his workers Advocated a minimum wage, and always paid his workers well. No child under 9 allowed to work in his mills. A school was attached to his mill. Supported the unsuccessful Grand Union of Operative Spinners trade union when it was set up. Built the model village of Saltaire for his workers. It had excellent housing (with gas and running water), almshouses, a hospital, schools, a library, a chapel, a public bathhouse and washhouse and parks.

It is one of many school districts across the country to get rid of recess time. Why? School officials say they want students to have more time to learn. They also hope that more time in class will help students perform better on tests. Should schools stop having recess? Why or why not?

266,2,"A photo of Saturn taken by Cassini on July 19, 2004. spacecraft has spent nearly seven years on a journey into the far reaches of space. During that time, it has covered more than 2 billion miles. In July, the spacecraft finally reached its destination--the ringed planet of Saturn. You could not stand on Saturn. Unlike Earth, Saturn does not have a solid surface. Saturn is made mostly of gases. Saturn is light because it is a ball of gas. If you built a HUGE swimming pool, Saturn would float in it. In fact, it is the only planet in the solar system that is less dense than water. Saturn is windy. The fastest winds on Saturn can reach about 1,100 miles per hour! In comparison, the fastest winds on Earth can reach about 250 miles per hour. Three other giant planets in the solar system have rings-Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. Saturn’s rings are the only ones that can be seen from Earth with a small telescope. ""The trip has sort of been like a long car drive, and we can’t wait to get out there and explore the sites,"" said NASA scientist Jeremy Jones about the mission. ""In a sense, the tour is just beginning."" Over the next four years, that tour will include studying Saturn, its rings, and its 33 known moons. Scientists say that Saturn holds clues to how the solar system formed. They think that Saturn and its moons are like a miniature version of our solar system. After darting through a gap in Saturn’s shimmering rings, , or flying a course around, the planet. , which is named after an early astronomer, weighs about 6 tons with fuel and is more than 22 feet long. That is about the size of a small school bus. is the most advanced spacecraft ever launched in history. The unmanned spacecraft is packed with equipment to collect information about Saturn. It holds two cameras, which are sending photos back to Earth. Saturn, the sixth planet from the sun, lies between Jupiter and Uranus. Of the nine planets in the solar system, Saturn is the second largest, after Jupiter. In fact, more than nine Earths would fit across Saturn. The planet’s rings are not solid. They are made up of particles of rock, ice, and dust. Some of the particles are as tiny as grains of sand. Others are as large as skyscrapers. Although the rings are wide, they are also very thin. The planet’s rings are only about half a mile thick. In addition to learning about the rings, scientists are studying Saturn’s moons. The scientists’ primary focus is Saturn’s largest moon, Titan. Titan is larger than the planets Mercury and Pluto. (HOY-ginz). The probe will parachute through the murky atmosphere of Titan and land on its surface. That will be the most far-reaching landing that a spacecraft has ever made from our planet. Scientists are interested in Titan because they think it might teach them about Earth. Experts used to think that Titan resembled Earth as it was billions of years ago. They are starting to question that idea. What do scientists expect to find? ""In many ways, the most exciting part of the journey is about to begin because we don’t know what lies ahead,"" said NASA scientist Julie Webster. Earth and the other planets in our solar system travel around the sun. Saturn is so far from the sun that it receives less sunlight than we get on Earth. The sun also looks much smaller from Saturn.

267,4,"The resources on the Earth are limited. It is important that the things we do now do not make things difficult or impossible for future generations. To achieve sustainable development, we need to balance these things carefully: the need for economic development, where standards of living improve respect for the environment and the resources it provides for us Recycling is an important way to help us achieve sustainable development. We can recycle many resources, including: Glass is easily recycled. It can be melted and remoulded to make new objects, such as bottles. The energy needed to do this is less than the energy needed to make new glass from its raw materials. However, we need to sort different coloured glass ready for recycling, and transport it to the recycling plant. Just like glass, it takes less energy to melt and remould metals than it does to extract new metals from their ores. Aluminium is a valuable metal that melts at a relatively low temperature, and is particularly attractive for recycling. However, a lot of metals that we use are mixtures called alloys, and it can be difficult to sort different metals ready for recycling. Paper is not melted when it is recycled. Instead, it is broken up into small pieces and reformed to make new sheets of paper. This takes less energy to do than making paper from trees. However, paper can only be recycled a few times before its fibres become too short to be useful, and the recycled paper is often only good enough for toilet paper or cardboard. But it can be used as a fuel or compost instead. from 2006 about a new school in Birmingham where most of the waste produced during its construction was recycled.

They can be separated from each other without a chemical reaction, in the way that different coloured sweets can be picked out from a mixed packet and put into separate piles. Mixtures have different properties from compounds. The table summarises these differences. Variable composition – you can vary the amount of each substance in a mixture. Definite composition – you cannot vary the amount of each element in a compound. The different substances are not chemically joined together. The different elements are chemically joined together. Each substance in the mixture keeps its own properties. The compound has properties different from the elements it contains. Each substance is easily separated from the mixture. It can only be separated into its elements using chemical reactions. Water, carbon dioxide, magnesium oxide, sodium chloride. An example - iron, sulfur and iron sulfide Remember that iron and sulfur react together when they are heated to make a compound called iron sulfide. What are the differences between a mixture of iron and sulfur, and iron sulfide? Here are some of them: The mixture can contain more or less iron, but iron sulfide always contains equal amounts of iron and sulfur. The iron and sulfur atoms are not joined together in the mixture, but they are joined together in iron sulfide. The iron and sulfur still behave like iron and sulfur in the mixture, but iron sulfide has different properties from both iron and sulfur. You can separate the iron from the mixture using a magnet but this does not work for iron sulfide. How will you react to this activity? More than 3000 video clips from BBC programmes.

274,4,"Just like Darwin and Lamarck, when presented with information about alternative views about the origin of life and the evolutionary process, you need to be able to: Identify statements that are data and statements that offer an explanation. For example, data is produced from an investigation and often but not always includes numbers. However, an explanation is a hypothesis that can be used to explain the data. If a scientist grows a micro-organism and counts the number of micro-organisms present every thirty minutes, the numbers he or she collects is . If the scientist notices that the number doubles every thirty minutes, he or she can use the data to produce an explanation, eg that Single-celled micro-organisms, some of which are pathogenic in humans, animals and plants. Singular is bacterium. divide every thirty minutes and the numbers increase exponentially. Recognise data or observations that are accounted for, or conflict with, an hardened remains or impressions of an organism that existed in the geological past can be dated by looking at the age of the rock in which they are found. The fossil record shows how organisms have changed over a period of time. The data supports the explanation of the theory of evolution. However, when the fossil data is compared with the theory that all life on Earth started just a few thousand years ago, the data does not support the explanation. in an explanation. For example, sometimes the data collected from an investigation does not immediately lead to an explanation. When Alexander Fleming noticed that bacteria were not growing next to the penicillium mould it took imagination and creativity for him to think that maybe the mould was producing a chemical that was killing the bacteria. That is how antibiotics were discovered. Identify a scientific question for which there is not an agreed answer. For example, did life evolve on planet Earth or did it arrive on a meteorite from outer space? Because no one was there at the time it is impossible to give an exact answer. Suggest why scientists involved in the same research sometimes disagree with each other. For example, many years ago, when scientists were first trying to date how old a fossil was, they sometimes disagreed. It was only when more evidence became available that they began to agree on the fossil’s age. You will also need to be able to suggest why some scientists are reluctant to change their minds and explanations, even when new evidence is found that contradicts them. This is often due to the fact that scientists devote their lives to their research. To realise that, after all the years they have spent on it, their theory was wrong, is very difficult to accept.

276,1,"Step aside, Spider-Man! Scientists recently invented a glue that works like geckos' feet. Geckos are little lizards that can scurry up walls. Their feet are lined with millions of tiny hairs that can on to a surface. To latch is to grab. The new glue is made with millions of tiny plastic fibers. The fibers grab hold as they slide across things. Like gecko feet, the glue releases easily. It doesn't leave a sticky film behind either. Scientist Ron Fearing helped create the glue. He compares it to how a toothbrush works. ""If I tap [a toothbrush] lightly against a surface, a few bristles will make contact,"" he says. ""But if I rub the toothbrush across the surface, the bristles bend and make ... more contact."" Scientists say that their research could be used to make gloves that would allow people to climb walls! All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation. "
277,4,"Earthquakes produce shock waves that cause damage. There are two types of seismic wave - p-waves and s-waves. Seismometers can detect these waves and provide evidence of the Earth’s structure. The ozone layer reduces the amount of ultraviolet light from the Sun that reaches the Earth’s surface. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation can lead to sunburn and skin cancer, but sunblocks can reduce this damage. Increased energy use and deforestation raise the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This leads to global warming. The Earth’s crust and upper mantle are broken up into huge . Where these meet, the Earth’s crust becomes unstable and earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur. Earthquakes cause damage to buildings, and often lead to loss of life. It is difficult to predict exactly when an earthquake might happen and how bad it will be, even in places that are known for having earthquakes. Earthquakes produce shock waves. These travel through the Earth and can be detected using a device called a There are two types of seismic wave. P-waves are longitudinal waves like sound waves, and s-waves are transverse waves like light waves Ultraviolet radiation is found naturally in sunlight. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation can cause: We cannot see or feel ultraviolet radiation, but our skin responds to it by turning darker. This happens in an attempt to reduce the amount of ultraviolet radiation that reaches deeper skin tissues. Darker skins absorb more ultraviolet light, so less ultraviolet radiation reaches the deeper tissues. This is important because ultraviolet radiation can cause normal cells to become cancerous. Sunblocks can reduce the damage caused by ultraviolet radiation. They contain chemicals that absorb a lot of the radiation and prevent it from reaching our skin. They may also contain chemicals that reflect some of the radiation away from the skin. Manufacturers of sunblocks make products with different sun protection the higher the factor, the longer you can stay out in the sun without burning high factor sunblocks reduce the risks from ultraviolet radiation more than low factor sunblocks If, for example, you would get sunburnt after ten minutes in the sun, with Factor 5 applied you could stay in the sun for 50 minutes - or for 1500 minutes with Factor 150 applied. But the real time is usually lower, because some of the sunblock gets absorbed by the skin, and some gets rubbed off. Dust from volcanoes reflects heat radiation from the Sun, leading to cooling. But dust from factories reflects heat radiation from cities, stopping it from escaping. This leads to warming in urban areas. . It absorbs heat energy that is radiated from the Earth’s surface and prevents it from escaping into space. This keeps the Earth warmer than it would otherwise be. But human activities are increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This increases the Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen at a higher rate since the 19th century The temperature of the earth has risen over the years Human activities leading to global warming include: Most of the energy we use comes from burning fossil fuels. These release carbon dioxide when they burn. So the increasing use of energy is leading to increasing amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. When land is cleared for timber and farms, there are fewer trees to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by photosynthesis. Also, if the fallen trees are burned or left to rot, additional carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere. A knowledge of how seismic waves travel through the Earth provides us with evidence of the Earth’s structure. Remember that: p-waves travel through solids and liquids, so they can travel through all of the Earth’s layers s-waves cannot travel through liquid rock, so they cannot travel through the outer core The speed of p-waves and s-waves increases as they travel deeper into the mantle. They travel through the Earth in curved paths, but they change direction suddenly when they pass through the boundary between substances in different states. The diagrams show what happens when p-waves and s-waves pass through the Earth: S-waves cannot pass through the liquid outer core, but p-waves can. When p-waves pass from solid to liquid, then from liquid to solid, there are sudden changes in direction. is the part of the upper atmosphere where ozone is found in the highest concentrations. The ozone there absorbs ultraviolet radiation, preventing most of it from reaching the ground. This is important because ultraviolet radiation can lead to skin cancer. , are chemicals that were once used widely in insulating foam and aerosol spray-cans. They release reactive chlorine atoms in the upper atmosphere. These break down ozone and damage the ozone layer. CFCs have now been almost completely replaced by chemicals that do not destroy ozone.

278,2,"Wild Weather: Is Global Warming Causing Unusual Storms? Residents of Barrow, Alaska, are stunned when a severe thunderstorm roars through town. The storm shocks the town; it is the first thunderstorm they have ever seen. For over 36 hours, a wild blizzard dumps about 100,000 tons of snow on a ski course in Austria. When even the ski lifts stop working, the storm puts a world championship skiing competition on hold. Those are just two of the many cases of wild weather, such as blizzards, tornadoes, hurricanes, and heat waves, that have been taking place around the world. A recent report from the United Nations (U.N.) says that wild weather may become increasingly common worldwide. The U.N. report blames the unusual weather on , or a rise in temperature worldwide. Certain gases, such as carbon dioxide, settle in Earth's atmosphere. Those gases act like the glass windows in a greenhouse, trapping heat from the sun and causing a rise in temperature. According to the report, during the next century, global warming will cause average temperatures worldwide to increase by 2 to 11 degrees Fahrenheit. World temperatures have been slowly increasing at least since 1850, when scientists began keeping records of world temperatures. The 1990s were the hottest ten years on record. Scientists aren't sure what is causing global warming. Most scientists agree that burning gasoline, oil, and coal as fuel is the most important cause. Burning those fuels releases lots of carbon dioxide. Some scientists, however, say global warming is mainly caused by forest fires, volcanic eruptions, and other natural events that release carbon dioxide into Earth's atmosphere. Craig Idso, from the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, said he doubts that worldwide temperatures will increase much more than they have already. According to Idso, an increase in carbon dioxide may be a good thing, since plants need carbon dioxide to grow. By taking in more of the gas, plants ""will grow like gangbusters,"" he said. The effects of global warming will vary from place to place, scientists say. In the United States, global warming could cause warmer weather in Alaska, more forest fires in California, crop failures in the Midwest, and longer growing seasons in the Northeast. In the meantime, many companies are working to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere. For example, automobile manufacturers are developing new fuels that could replace gasoline and limit carbon dioxide emissions. Michael Glantz, from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said that people will learn how to live with global warming. ""Society is more robust than we give it credit for,"" he said. ""People may learn to live more comfortably in a new, warmer world."" The Heat Is On: Will Global Warming Affect Animals? All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation. "

280,1,"Welcome home, Hua Mei (HWAH MAY)! Hua Mei is the first giant panda born in the United States to survive and go to the panda's homeland of China. Hua Mei, now 4 years old, was born at the San Diego Zoo in California. In 1996, China loaned her parents to the United States. The two nations agreed that any cubs born in the United States would be sent to China. A few months ago, Hua Mei arrived in China by airplane. Now she lives in a protected nature center with other pandas. ""She seems quite happy to be in the land of her ancestors,"" said one spokesperson. Giant pandas are an endangered species. They live in the forests of southwestern China. Experts estimate that fewer than 1,000 giant pandas live in the wild. All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation. "

I was nervous and excited when I got to the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on October 5, 2006. I was there to report on former U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush. They were getting the 2006 Liberty Medal Award together for their joint efforts to raise more than $1 billion to help the victims of the tsunami that hit parts of southern Asia and eastern Africa in 2004 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. There were hundreds of adults dressed in gowns and tuxedos. Secret Service agents were all around. The medals were given to the presidents by a student from Indonesia and a 13-year-old girl from New Orleans. The presidents made friendly jokes about their experiences working together and encouraged people to join their efforts to help those affected by the disasters. kid reporter is on the scene as two former U.S. presidents receive Liberty Medals. Poet Mona Lisa Saloy wrote a beautiful piece for the event called ""WE: A Poem."" She got her point across that if we work together, we can accomplish anything, and she thanked Bush and Clinton.
