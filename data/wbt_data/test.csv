7,4,"Between now and the reading exam you need a clear idea of how to practise and improve. Make sure that you have a vocabulary book/record that covers each area of the syllabus. Build up your personal vocabulary by learning a small number of new words every day. Get plenty of regular practice. Use past papers. Use this website - both the Revision Bites and the Test Bites. Make sure you are familiar with different types of task, for example, multiple choice, filling in a grid, matching, gap filling, answering in Spanish, and answering in English. Go over some questions with a friend. It will give you a chance to look at someone else's exam technique. You might learn from each other. Make sure you are confident with recognising the full range of words that introduce questions: ¿dónde? ¿quién? ¿cómo? ¿por qué ? ¿cuándo? ¿qué? ¿cuál? ¿cuánto? Try to find opportunities to read Spanish for pleasure without the pressure of questions and time limits, for instance magazines, Spanish-language CDs with song lyrics, comics. This will help you build up your vocabulary. Make sure you know how to use your dictionary to look up words any you don't know, and make a note of them so you can revise them before the exam. Look at the Revision Bite on You must come to the exam with a clear idea of the strategies that will help you work well under pressure. Here are some suggestions Don't panic! You are not expected to understand every word of the text. Take a positive approach to your reading. Concentrate on what you do understand, not on the difficult words and phrases. Have a good look at the title of the text as well as any illustrations. They may give you some important clues. Read the whole text before attempting to answer any questions. It is usually better to read the text twice at a brisk pace, than to struggle along once, slowly. Be clear as to exactly what each question wants. For example, should you be picking out precise details (for example, the date of someone's birthday) or should you be reading the whole passage in order to draw some broad conclusions (for example, a comparison of two people's attitudes to television)? Be aware of different ways of finding out the meaning of words. For example: Can you guess the meaning of a difficult word in a sentence if you understand what all the other words mean? Can you find similarities between Spanish and English words? (eg Can you find links with other Spanish words? (eg Are you aware of language patterns? (eg 're' in front of a word often means again: Use your knowledge of grammar. For example, if you can identify a plural, a verb tense, an adjective, an adverb or a preposition, you will be in a better position to make an intelligent guess at a meaning. Use your knowledge of Spain and Spanish-speaking countries. For example, knowing about the Spanish educational system could be very useful if you are working on a text about school. If you have to write answers in Spanish, be as clear as possible; but remember you will Don't spend too long on a difficult item. Come back to it later. Now decide which strategies will work best for you and practise using them as much as you can between now and the day of the exam. The more you practise them, the more you are likely to remember to use them during the exam itself. "
8,4,"During the 1930s, Britain and France followed a policy of The policy of pacifying an aggressor through giving in to their demands, thus maintaining peace. . So why did Britain and France keep on giving in to Hitler's demands? Chamberlain believed the Munich Agreement would appease Hitler As the League of Nations crumbled, politicians turned to a new way to keep the peace - appeasement. This was the policy of giving Hitler what he wanted to stop him from going to war. It was based on the idea that and, when his reasonable demands had been satisfied, he would stop. Although historians recognise appeasement in the actions of Britain and France before 1938 (look at the page on for examples), the Sudeten Crisis of 1938 is the key example of appeasement in action. Neville Chamberlain was the British prime minister who believed in appeasement. In 1938, Germans living in the border areas of Czechoslovakia (the Sudetenland) started to demand a union with Hitler's Germany. The Czechs refused. Hitler threatened war. On 30 September, in the Munich Agreement - without asking Czechoslovakia - Britain and France Hitler encourages Konrad Henlein, leader of the Sudeten Nazis, to rebel, and demands a union with Germany. When the Czech government declares martial law, Hitler threatens war. Chamberlain goes to see Hitler at Berchtesgaden. Without consulting Czechoslovakia, he promises to give Hitler all the areas where more than 50 per cent of the population is German. Then he persuades France to agree. Chamberlain goes to Bad Godesberg to tell Hitler about the decision, but Hitler now demands ALL the Sudetenland. Chamberlain refuses; it looks like war. Chamberlain calls the crisis 'a quarrel in a faraway country, between people of whom we know nothing'. At Munich, France and Britain agree to give Hitler the Sudetenland. Chamberlain waves 'a piece of paper' with Hitler's statement that he does not want to go to war. German troops march into the Sudetenland, and are welcomed as heroes. There were many reasons why Chamberlain appeased Hitler, but here are the main ones: - they would not have supported a war in 1938. at the time - especially about the Treaty of Versailles. to serve as a barrier against expansion by communist Russia. Britain's armed forces were not ready for a war , and they could not have helped Czechoslovakia anyway. . In 1938, the American magazine 'Time' declared him 'Man of the Year'. ; he thought another war would destroy civilisation. Five countries were involved in the Munich Crisis of September 1938.

The people of Britain realised that they had been , and decided that war was inevitable. of the British people, who knew they had done everything possible to avoid war. Read this famous statement by Neville Chamberlain broadcast on the radio on 27 September 1938. Looking at the reasons for appeasement in this section (page 3), which do you think weighed heaviest on Chamberlain's mind as he spoke? How horrible, fantastic, incredible it is, that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas-masks here, because of a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing... However much we may sympathise with a small nation confronted by a big and powerful neighbour, we cannot in all circumstances undertake to involve the whole British Empire in war simply on her account. If we have to fight, it must be on larger issues than that. I am myself a man of peace to the depths of my soul; armed conflict between nations is a nightmare to me... War is a fearful thing, and we must be very clear before we embark on it, that it is really the great issues that are at stake. There is often no right or wrong answer to questions about appeasement, which is very much a matter of . However, when you consider what is known for sure about Chamberlain's position, remember: Britain's armed forces could not have helped Czechoslovakia. Notice how Chamberlain calls Czechoslovakia (point 4 in list of reasons for appeasement). Chamberlain remembered the slaughter of the First World War (6). This is the main point of the quote, especially ""I am myself a man of peace to the depths of my soul; armed conflict between nations is a nightmare to me... War is a fearful thing"" It could be argued that he was empathising with the reluctance of the British people to go to war (1), when he called digging trenches and trying on gas masks ""...we must be very clear before we embark on it, that it is really the great issues that are at stake"" However, there is NO evidence that Chamberlain thought Hitler was reasonable (2), or that he wanted a strong Germany (3), or that he admired Hitler (5). In fact, the tone towards Hitler is hostile: ""...we may sympathise with a small nation confronted by a big and powerful neighbour"" As part of your revision, think about the Chamberlain hoped that appeasement would keep the peace.

Different versions of the same gene are called alleles, and these can determine features such as eye colour, and the inheritance of disorders such as cystic fibrosis.

The instructions for how an organism develops are found in the The plural of nucleus. The nucleus controls what happens inside the cell. Chromosomes are structures found in the nucleus of most cells Rod shaped bodies found in the nucleus of cells that contain genetic information (DNA). are structures found in the nucleus of most cells. They consist of long strands of a substance called The material inside the nucleus of cells, carrying genetic information. DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic Acid. for short. A section of DNA that has the genetic code for making a particular protein is called a The basic unit of genetic material inherited from our parents. A gene is a section of DNA which controls part of a cell's chemistry - particularly protein production. structural proteins such as the ones found in muscles and hair enzymes, such as proteases and other digestive enzymes Human body cells each contain 23 pairs of Rod shaped bodies found in the nucleus of cells that contain genetic information (DNA). The basic units of genetic material inherited from our parents. A gene is a section of DNA which controls part of a cell's chemistry - particularly protein production. to their offspring in their sex cells. female sex cells are called egg cells, or ova A pair of chromosomes carry the same genes, in the same place, on the chromosome. However, there are different versions of a gene called . These alleles may be the same on each pair of chromosomes, or different, for example, blue eyes or brown eyes. Sex cells only contain one chromosome from each pair. When an egg cell and sperm cell join together, the fertilised egg cell contains 23 pairs of chromosomes. One chromosome in each pair comes from the mother, the other from the father. Which chromosome we get from each pair is completely random. This means different children in the same family will each get a different combination. This is why children in the same family look a little like each other and a little like each parent, but are not identical to them. A set of chromosomes can be separated from its cell, spread out on a microscope slide and magnified many thousands of times. When stained and photographed, they look like this: The highlighted pair of chromosomes are called the sex chromosomes. The longer sex chromosome is called the X chromosome, the shorter one the Y chromosome. When sex cells form, the pairs of sex Rod shaped bodies found in the nucleus of cells that contain genetic information (DNA). (XX and XY) are separated. Remember that females carry XX, males XY. This means: all normal egg cells produced by a human ovary have an X chromosome half of the sperm carry an X chromosome, and half a Y So a human baby’s gender is determined by the sperm that fertilises the egg cell. The baby will be a girl if it carries an X chromosome. It will be a boy if the fertilising sperm carries a Y chromosome. Study the animation below to test your understanding of this. Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment. For information on how to enable JavaScript please go to the You will not be able to see this content until you have JavaScript switched on. Notice that half of the babies should be male, and half female. Individual families often have more, or less, boys than girls, but in a large population there will be roughly equal numbers. This is for the same reason that if you toss a coin many times you will get roughly equal numbers of ‘heads’ and ‘tails’. Some societies prefer to have male children. It is now possible to choose the sex of a child using IVF. Some people think parents should be able to choose the sex of their children, especially if they have a child that dies, or have had three or four children of the same sex. Other people think we should not be able to choose, because this could affect the balance of males and females in society, or because they believe it is against God or nature. . Science can provide information and data, but it cannot answer questions about values. Values often result in different people coming to different decisions. This is why some people think we should be able to choose the sex of our children, while others do not. The Y chromosome carries a gene called the ‘sex-determining region Y’, or SRY for short. The SRY gene causes testes to develop in an XY embryo. These produce : male sex hormones. Androgens cause the embryo to become a male. Without them, the embryo develops into a female. Individuals differ in all sorts of ways, even when they are offspring of the same parents. These differences are called Most characteristics, such as height, are determined by several genes working together. They are also influenced by environmental factors. These include: For example, an individual might inherit a tendency to tallness, but a poor diet during childhood will result in poor growth and a shorter individual. Identical twins are genetically the same. They are a good example of the interaction between inheritance and the environment. For example, an identical twin who takes regular exercise will have better muscle tone than one who does not. All of the differences that you see between identical twins, for example, in personality, tastes and aptitude, are due to differences in their experiences or environment. Rod shaped bodies found in the nucleus of cells that contain genetic information (DNA). The basic units of genetic material inherited from our parents. A gene is a section of DNA which controls part of a cell's chemistry - particularly protein production. in the same places. But there are different versions of the same gene. Different versions of the same gene are called , which is pronounced al-eels. For example, the gene for eye colour has an allele for blue eye colour and an allele for brown. For any gene, a person may have the same two alleles, or two different ones. Alleles may be either recessive or dominant. allele only shows if the individual has two copies of it. For example, the allele for blue eyes is recessive. You need two copies of this allele to have blue eyes. allele always shows, even if the individual only has one copy of it. For example, the allele for brown eyes is dominant. You only need one copy of it to have brown eyes. Two copies will still give you brown eyes. Individuals A and B have brown eyes - only individual C has blue eyes Only individual C will have blue eyes, because the allele for blue eyes is recessive. because, even though they have brown eyes, they still carry the allele for blues eyes and can pass this allele on to future generations. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by a recessive . In the genetic diagram below, it is written as f. People with CF produce abnormally thick and sticky mucus in their lungs and airways. As a result, they are more likely to get respiratory infections. Daily physiotherapy helps to relieve congestion, while Substances that kill bacteria and fungal infections. can fight infection. CF also affects the gut and large gland located in the abdomen near the stomach which produces digestive enzymes and the hormone insulin , so food is not digested efficiently. You need to inherit two copies of the faulty allele to be born with CF. If you have just one copy, you are a carrier, but will not experience any symptoms. If two carriers have a child together, there is a one in four chance of it inheriting the disorder. Huntington’s disorder is caused by a dominant , written as H. The symptoms usually develop in middle age, and include problems with controlling your muscles and forgetfulness. You only need to inherit one copy of the faulty allele to have Huntington’s disorder, unlike cystic fibrosis, where you need to inherit both copies. You can inherit Huntington’s disorder if one or both of your parents carry the faulty allele, because it is a an allele that always expresses itself whether it is partnered by a recessive allele or by another like itself You can show inheritance of the disorder using genetic diagrams. In this example, one parent, the mother, carries one copy of the Huntington’s allele. She has the disorder. The father does not carry the Huntington’s allele, so he does not have the disorder. There is a 1:2, or 50 per cent, chance of them producing a child with the disorder. Note that in an individual family, by chance, all of the children may inherit the disorder, or none at all. In this example, both parents carry one copy of the Huntington’s . Both have the disorder. There is a 3:4, or 75 per cent, chance of them producing a child with the disorder. Note that in an individual family, by chance, all of the children might inherit the disorder. It is also possible for none of them to inherit the disorder, although this is less likely than in the first example. In this instance, one parent, the mother, carries one copy of the Huntington’s allele. The father carries two copies. Both have the disorder. All of their children will have it, too. Scientists are now able to test adults and foetuses for alleles which can cause genetic diseases. However, the scientific information produced raises many issues that science cannot address. For example, should a couple with a one in four risk of having a child with cystic fibrosis take the gamble, or decide not to have any children at all? If a woman becomes pregnant with a child that is going to have cystic fibrosis, should she have the child, or choose to have an abortion? These are questions about values that science cannot answer. Different people will have different views. "

13,3,"Whenever an object moves against another object, it feels forces. These forces act in the opposite direction to the movement. Friction makes it harder for things to move. friction between our shoes and the floor stop us from slipping friction between tyres and the road stop cars from skidding friction between the brakes and wheel help bikes and cars slow down Frictional forces are much smaller on smooth surfaces than on rough surfaces, which is why we slide on ice. Friction can also be unhelpful. If you don't lubricate your bike regularly with oil, the friction in the chain and axles increases. Your bike will be noisy and difficult to pedal. When there is a lot of friction between moving parts, energy is lost to the surroundings as . Think of what happens when you rub your hands together quickly. The friction warms them up. as they move. Air resistance is caused by the frictional forces of the air against the vehicle. The faster the vehicle moves, the bigger the air resistance becomes. The top speed of a vehicle is reached when the force from the cyclist or engine is balanced by air resistance. Racing cyclists crouch down low on their bikes to the air resistance on them. This helps them to cycle faster. They also wear streamlined helmets. These have special, smooth shapes that allow the air to flow over the cyclist more easily. Modern cars are also streamlined. Their smooth shapes make the air resistance smaller, which allows them to travel further on the same amount of fuel. Something is pulling your mouse towards this link.

The League was Wilson's dream for a - a new way of conducting foreign affairs that would abolish war and keep the world safe, but less than a quarter of a century later Wilson's dream lay in ruins. Aims, strengths and weaknesses - the basics The League of Nations was set up by the Treaty of Versailles. were to stop wars, encourage disarmament, and make the world a better place by improving people's working conditions, and by tackling disease. comprised an assembly, which met once a year; a council, which met more regularly to consider crises; a small secretariat to handle the paperwork; a Court of International Justice; and a number of committees such as the International Labour Organisation and the Health Committee to carry out its humanitarian work. was that it had set up by the Treaty of Versailles, which every nation had signed, and it had 58 nations as members by the 1930s. To enforce its will, it could offer arbitration through the Court of International Justice, or apply trade sanctions against countries that went to war. were the fact that it was set up by the Treaty of Versailles (which every nation hated); that its aims were too ambitious; that Germany, Russia and the USA were not members; that it had no army; that its organisation was cumbersome; and that decisions had to be unanimous. The Covenant of the League of Nations The League of Nations was set up by the first 26 clauses of the Treaty of Versailles - called 'The Covenant of the League of Nations' . The table below is a summary. 3. Set up the assembly - a meeting of all members of the League. 42 countries were members (rising to 58 in 1934). The USA, USSR and Germany - the three greatest powers in the world - were not members. 4. Set up the council (Britain, France, Italy and Japan, plus four other countries elected by the assembly), which met four to five times a year and in times of crisis. Allowed the League to respond quickly to crises. However, the council members were not the most powerful countries in the world, and were not prepared to use their armies. Also sometimes council members were involved in the trouble. 5. Said that agreements of the assembly and council had to be unanimous. Made it very hard to get anything done.

Take a look, then think about how you might answer a question on Romeo's descriptions of love. Love is an excellent subject for poets. Romeo enjoys using lots of different poetic devices to explore the idea of love. The idea of love seems to be making Romeo's brain ache. He comes up with a list of oxymorons (pairs of opposite words eg 'loving hate') to try and find the right definition of love. He makes up some vivid metaphors for love, but comes closer with his descriptions to lust. He thinks love is a kind of madness or even a poison. He thinks that he loves Rosaline. He compares her to a Roman goddess and complains that Cupid keeps missing her heart with his arrows. He focuses on her beauty and talks about his problems getting her to love him back as though it is a kind of battle. At this point in the play, Romeo doesn't seem to understand what true love is. It is possible that he has got some of his romantic ideas from stories. He likes talking about love, but some of his opinions don't sound very loving. We never meet Rosaline in the play, but you may think to yourself that she is wise not to encourage Romeo's advances. They don't sound respectful or honourable. In fact, it could be argued that Romeo's ideas about love are funny or silly, and show him up to be immature and shallow.

22,4,"The phrase 'classical music' often refers to all music which is not 'pop'. But in music history 'Classical' refers to the music composed between 1750 and 1810. Although we date the Classical period as starting around 1750 the transition from Baroque was an evolution not a clean break. Many musical forms persisted, and the Classical symphony grew out of the Baroque trio sonata: dynamics (or volume) now uses crescendo and diminuendo (getting louder and quieter) timpani are often the only percussion used : an important melody which occurs more than once in a piece of music. A theme may be just a melodic figure. : the repetition of a melodic figure or phrase is repeated at a higher or lower pitch. : a bass line that consists of broken chords, a prominent feature of Classical music. : the notes of a chord played one after another instead of at the same time. : for playing in a room or chamber, ie written for a small number of instruments. For example, a string quartet (2 violins, viola and cello), piano trio (violin, cello and piano) or string sextet. : expanded in size, dynamics and textual range. , in contrast to mainly polyphonic Baroque, and so lighter and clearer. Many forms, eg the suite, the concerto, the overture, the mass, the chorale - continued little changed from the Baroque period. Below are some distinctive forms typical of Classical music. : a large orchestral work, usually in four contrasting movements. : a dance in 3/4, often part of a Minuet and Trio. : consisting of two themes or groups of themes, linked by a bridge passage. The three sections are known as 'exposition', 'development', and 'recapitulation'. : a Roman Catholic mass for the dead with solo voices, chorus and orchestra. : A dramatic piece for orchestra, chorus and vocal soloists combining acting with music. An opera starts with an overture, for orchestra followed by choruses and arias (a solo singer with orchestra). They also have recitatives, half spoken and half sung music. The harpsichord continuo gradually fell out of use. There was a growing use of wind instruments, especially horns. In the early classical period, orchestras were still small and variable, typically strings, 2 horns, 1 or 2 flutes or a pair of oboes. Later composers included flutes and oboes, 1 or 2 bassoons, and occasionally 2 trumpets and a pair of kettledrums. Clarinets found a regular place towards the end of the 18th century. During the Classical period music for instruments became more important than music for voices for the first time. from Italy invented the piano as early as 1698. By 1700 he had built one and called it , (harpsichord with soft and loud). Instead of plucking the strings they were struck by small hammers. With lots of piano music being written the Alberti bass developed, consisting of simple broken chords repeated in the left hand. was one of the first musical celebrities when he performed as a child before the Emperor of Austria in Vienna. Essentially this was a sonata, which had 3 or 4 contrasting sections, played by the orchestra. It was also influenced by the Italian overture, which had three sections: fast, slow, fast. The three movements of the early symphony became four with the addition of the Minuet and Trio. slower speed, more song-like, often in ternary form (3 parts in the pattern: ABA) fast speed, light-hearted, often in rondo form (4 parts in the pattern: ABACA) The concerto features a solo instrument in competition with the orchestra, developed from Baroque solo concerto. The soloists and orchestra are of equal importance. There is a dialogue between melodic lines and themes between the soloist and orchestra, with each taking turns to accompany the other. There are three movements (fast, slow, fast) like the early symphony (no minuet or trio). "

32,2,"More bears are alive and well, but are they ready to come off the endangered species list? The bears are back after being on the brink of extinction in and around Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone is located in the states of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. Now the U.S. government may remove the grizzly from its list of endangered species in this area. ""The future of the Yellowstone grizzly bears is bright,"" says Chris Servheen of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. That wasn’t always the case. The numbers of grizzlies began to shrink in the early 1900s largely because ranchers hunted the animals and farmers destroyed their By 1975, only 220 to 320 bears still lived in the Yellowstone area. That year, the grizzly was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, which offers special protection to animals facing extinction. Today, wildlife experts estimate that more than 600 bears live in the region surrounding Yellowstone. Grizzly bears live in other parts of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming as well as Washington state and will remain on the list in those areas. Grizzlies in Alaska, which number about 30,000, have never been on the list because that population is healthy. It’s Not Time Yet Not everyone thinks it’s a good decision to remove grizzlies from the list. Some wildlife officials fear that if the bear is removed from the list, its habitat around Yellowstone could be used for logging, oil drilling, and development. Others worry that the bears will be hunted again. ""We would love to see the grizzly bear delisted, but it’s not ready,"" says wildlife supporter Louisa Wilcox. ""If you want to protect bears for future generations, you have to protect the habitat they need. This plan doesn’t do it."" Should grizzlies no longer be listed as an endangered species? Why or why not? The grizzly’s return isn’t the only species success story. Take a look at some other animals that are being saved, thanks to tough laws and hardworking scientists. In 1963, only 417 pairs of bald eagles nested in the United States. There are now more than 6,400 pairs, and the national symbol may soon be removed from the list of endangered species. Hawaiians used to hunt this reptile for dinner. Now they swim alongside the turtles near some islands. The number of nesting females has jumped to more than 400 a year. There were only 67 in 1973. Pollution and habitat loss have made it hard for sea otters to stay afloat. In 1938, there were only several hundred otters off the coast of California.

38,3,"Drama - Drama from your imagination Taking part in drama doesn't always involve learning lines from scripts - often you'll be asked to improvise. Usually you will work in groups or pairs to devise a piece of drama from your own imagination. You'll need to be able to think on your feet and become a different character. This might sound difficult, but you've probably improvised before without realising it - in games you used to play as a child. If you've ever played pirates, nurses or superheroes when you were younger, you were improvising - although don't think running around your classroom with a tablecloth for a cape pretending to be Superman will impress your drama teacher - it probably won't! As with any English work, you need to think about your audience when you devise drama. Your drama needs to entertain them and keep their attention. Your drama also needs to be believable - your audience is likely to become disconnected if your story or characters are too far fetched. The story of your drama begins with your character. Ask yourself: what does my character feel, think and react? Here are two ideas for a character: You are a journalist who has uncovered a story that will have big consequences and you're about to tell the world. Would your character be confident or scared? You are a global superstar - singer, actor and producer - and paparazzi follow your every move. You live a glamorous and privileged life, but what are the secrets behind the smiles? When you have decided on your character, you need to create a scene. Here are some ideas for a scene based on the characters above. Can you think of any more? You're about to appear on the most popular morning TV programme and expose your discovery when you suddenly receive a startling phone call. Who is on the phone? What do they say? How do they make you feel? You've landed a part in a popular soap but you don't get on with the other actors. Should you tell the press the truth or pretend that you all get along? You've been working late in the library just double checking a few facts for your article when you notice a menacing looking man watching you. Does your character panic or keep calm? Do they run or confront the man? Maybe they are being paranoid? The press have published some false rumours about you and you're really upset. Your agent has secured a slot on a popular chat show to give your side of the story. Do you accept the offer or decide to lie low? How do you feel? Your article has been published and has been a massive hit. You're receiving job offers from high profile newspapers and magazines and your life is about to change for the better. How do your family react? What do you decide to do? You've found out that one of the other band members is planning to leave the group and go solo. You confront them - can you persuade them to stay, or would it be better for everyone if they left? When you have a rough idea of your character and scene, you can think about what your character might say. If you're given time to prepare you should write a short script. If working in pairs or a group, you could improvise the scene first to get more ideas. You may be allowed to use props to make your scene more realistic and interesting.

40,3,"It's good to have a variety of sentences. You can have short ones, and then some long ones. But as we have already seen, if they are all simple sentences, then it gets boring and difficult to read. You should also use a mixture of questions and statements. Imagine giving some advice to a friend who is being bullied. You'd probably think of a few ideas very quickly: You could improve your work by adding other types of sentences. At the moment, it's just a list of orders. What about adding a question or two? Like this: Why don't you talk to someone at school about it? Do you know anyone else who is being bullied right now? This pushes your friend to think about something. It also gives them the opportunity to start talking about it. Then you could add a statement or two, like this: Bullying is more common than many people think. The worst thing about being bullied is feeling alone. If we combine these ideas and sentences, we have an interesting and varied piece of writing. All we need to add are some connectives, like 'and', 'but', 'so' or 'because'. Now we have writing that makes a real impact and which can offer advice as well as persuading people, like this: Do you know anyone else who is being bullied right now? Why don't you talk to someone at school about it? Because bullying is far more common than many people think. And it is far more serious than many people imagine. In fact, it is one of the main reasons for pupils missing school. But the worst thing about being bullied is feeling alone. So don't suffer in silence, tell your family about it and do something now.

In the face of the nation's growing health and nutrition problems, many schools have banned soft drinks and other high-sugar snacks from vending machines. As a result, the pressure is on for soft-drink companies to find new ways to stay in school. Some companies, such as Coca-Cola and Cadbury Schweppes, are introducing new milk-based drinks in different flavors to be sold in schools. Some experts claim, though, that the milk-based drinks are still too high in sugar. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration won't allow the makers of those products to use the word in their names.

As part of a deal with New York City, Snapple will be the only drink company to have vending machines in the city's schools. To meet the city's rules banning high-sugar foods from schools, Snapple had to create four new 100-percent juice drinks. Not good enough, say some nutrition experts who claim the new Snapple drinks have more calories and sugar in them than soft drinks have. Unlike orange juice and grapefruit juice, the new juices contain only small amounts of nutrients and vitamins. ""The fact is... they are pretty much the same as a [soft drink],"" said one expert.

50,4,"Selective breeding is the traditional method for improving crops and livestock, such as increasing disease resistance or milk yield. Genetic engineering is a faster way, which transplants genes for a desired characteristic into an organism. However, genetic engineering offers many potential benefits but carries the risk of unexpected harmful effects. Over the centuries humans have tried to breed better crops and livestock. Traditionally this was done by carefully choosing parents for breeding that show the required characteristics - . More recently it's been possible to implant particular genes using . Both these techniques depend on there being in the genetic material – which is caused by . Most mutations are harmful to an individual, but occasionally a mutation can be beneficial. It's possible to speed up mutation rates artificially using radiation or chemicals. Mutations bring about changes in organisms by changing the sequence of bases in DNA. This causes a different protein to be made, or blocks the production of the protein completely. These are the steps in selective breeding: from parents to breed the next generation wheat by crossbreeding wheat plants with disease resistance and wheat plants with a high yield. by selecting bulls from high yield herds and breeding them with cows that have the best milk production. Selective breeding can also be used to modify other characteristics of cattle. Aberdeen Angus bull - bred for beef Problems with selective breeding - higher tier Future generations of selectively bred organisms will all share very more dangerous as all the organisms would be affected. Also there's increased risk of genetic disease caused by Some genes would be lost, making it more difficult to produce new varieties in the future. In scientific language this would be described as ‘inbreeding can lead to a reduction in the size of the gene pool’. way of producing new varieties is to transfer the genes for the desired characteristic into an organism . This is genetic engineering. The gene may have come from the same species, but genetic engineering also allows the genes from an unrelated organism to be transferred – something that's not possible with selective breeding. People lacking vitamin A in their traditional diet can make the vitamin if they eat genetically modified ‘golden’ rice. ‘Human’ insulin can be made cheaply and quickly by bacteria to treat diabetics. Genetically modified soya beans can be sprayed with weedkiller and remain unaffected, so only weeds are killed. This increases yields of soya. Genetic engineering can be used to create of plant and animal, but there's a that there could be unexpected harmful effects, either to the new organism or if the gene ‘escapes’ into the surrounding populations.

56,4,"Metals are very useful. Ores are naturally occurring rocks that contain metal or metal compounds in sufficient amounts to make it worthwhile extracting them. The method used to extract a given metal from its ore depends upon the reactivity of the metal and so how stable the ore is. , while less reactive metals are extracted by Reduction is a reaction in which oxygen is removed from a substance. Reduction also means a gain in electrons. Most metals must be extracted from rocks, called ores, in the Earth's crust. Ores contain the metal, or a compound of the metal, in a high enough concentration to make it worth extracting the metal. is the gain of oxygen by a substance. For example, magnesium is oxidised when it reacts with oxygen to form magnesium oxide: is the loss of oxygen from a substance. For example, copper oxide can be reduced to form copper if it is reacted with hydrogen: copper oxide + hydrogen → copper + water Many ores contain metal oxides, therefore many metals can be extracted from their ores by reduction reactions. The method used to extract a given metal depends on how reactive it is. The method used to extract a metal from its ore depends upon the stability of its compound in the ore, which in turn depends upon the reactivity of the metal: The oxides of very reactive metals, such as aluminium, form stable oxides and other compounds. A lot of energy is needed to reduce them to extract the metal. The oxides of less unreactive metals, such as iron, form less stable oxides and other compounds. Relatively little energy is needed to reduce them to extract the metal. So, the method of extraction of a metal from its ore depends on the metal's position in the reactivity series. Reactive metals such as aluminium are extracted by electrolysis, while a less-reactive metal such as iron may be extracted by reduction with carbon. Gold, because it is so unreactive, is found as the native metal and not as a compound, so it does not need to be chemically separated. However, chemical reactions may be needed to remove other elements that might contaminate the metal. "

61,3,"If someone is cooking in the kitchen it doesn't take long for the smell to travel around the house to other rooms. This is because of diffusion. When chemicals, like the smell of perfume or burning toast, are let loose in a room, the particles mix with the air particles. The particles of smelly gas are free to move quickly in all directions. They eventually spread through the whole room. This is called You don't have to mix the gases by waving your arms around - it mixes on its own. Diffusion in gases is quick because the particles in a gas move quickly. It happens even faster in hot gases Diffusion can also happen in liquids. This is because the particles in liquids can move around each other, which means that eventually they are evenly mixed. For example if you drop a little bit of paint into a jar of water the colour will spread slowly through the water. This is by diffusion. Diffusion in liquids is slower than diffusion in gases because the particles in a liquid move more slowly. happen at all in solids because the particles in a solid can only vibrate on the spot, rather than being able to move from place to place.

On its way back to shore, the sub disappeared. In 1995, a team of divers found the in the water off the coast of South Carolina. The sub was filled with 65,000 pounds of sand and water. In August, divers put 32 thick straps around the sub. The straps were attached to a steel frame that surrounded the sub. A huge crane lifted the frame and the sub from the water in only three minutes. Now scientists will clean and study the sub. Scientists hope to solve the mystery of the sub's disappearance.

63,4,"Background radiation released by soil, rocks and cosmic rays is always in the environment. Radioisotopes are used as tracers in medicine and industry. Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon, which is found in all living organisms. We can estimate the age of dead organisms by measuring the amount of carbon-14 left in them. in the environment in the form of alpha particles, beta particles and gamma rays. Most is released by radioactive substances in soil and rocks and cosmic rays from outer space. Radiation that reaches the Earth from outerspace All animals emit natural levels of radiation Some rocks give off radioactive radon gas Radioactive materials from rocks in the ground are absorbed by the soil and hence passed on to plants Not all background radiation occurs naturally. A small amount is caused by humans. Nuclear bombs have been exploded by humans, releasing radiation into the environment. A form of radiation we encounte when we travel by air or have a chest x-ray in a hospital. Nuclear power stations have released radiation into the environment The pie chart below shows proportions of man made background radiation: in industry and hospitals. They're used to find out what is happening In industry they can be used to: find leaks or blockages in underground pipes To locate a leak in an underground pipe a very small amount of radioactive material that gives off gamma rays is put into the pipe. A detector is moved along the ground above the pipe. The leak is located where there's an increase in activity and little or no activity after that point. One type of smoke detector uses Americium-241, an alpha source, to detect smoke. The alpha particles pass between the two charged metal plates, causing air particles to ionise (split into positive and negative ions). The ions are attracted to the oppositely charged metal plates causing a current to flow. When smoke enters between the plates, some of the alpha particles are absorbed causing less ionisation to take place. This means a smaller than normal current flows so the alarm sounds. of carbon (it has two extra neutrons in its nucleus making it unstable). There's a small amount of radioactive carbon-14 in all living organisms. When they die no new carbon-14 is taken in by the dead organism. The carbon-14 it contained at the time of death decays over a long period of time. By measuring the amount of carbon-14 left in dead organic material the approximate time since it died can be worked out. Some people believe the Turin shroud is almost 2000 years old and the burial cloth of Jesus Christ. It was carbon dated in 1988, and scientists found the shroud to be from the 13th of 14th century. . Uranium has a very long half-life and so by measuring how much uranium is left in a rock its approximate age can be worked out. More radioactive dating - higher tier only The amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere has not changed in thousands of years. Even though it decays into nitrogen, new carbon-14 is always being formed when cosmic rays hit atoms high in the atmosphere. Plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and animals eat plants. This means all living things have radioactive carbon-14 in them. When an organism, eg a tree, dies it stops taking in carbon dioxide. The amount of carbon-14 in the wood decreases with time as it decays into nitrogen with a half-life of about 5700 years. By comparing how much carbon-14 there is in the dead organism with the amount in a living one, the age of the dead organism can be estimated. The half-life of uranium-238 is 4500 million years. When it decays it forms thorium-234 which is also unstable. Finally, after a series of radioactive isotopes are formed it becomes lead-206, which is stable. The age of the rock can be calculated if the ratio of uranium to lead is known. As the rock gets older the proportion of lead increases. If half of the uranium-238 has turned into lead-206 the rock will be 4500 million years old. "

68,4,"Answer the questions below using information from the text and your knowledge of biology. These written materials are examples for revision practice only. They are not from any exam papers. K2 is the second highest mountain in the world at 8611m. Mountain climbers say it is even harder to climb than Mount Everest, which was climbed one year before the first successful attempt on K2. . Hypothermia and frostbite occur as the nose, fingers and toes begin to freeze. Winds can reach over 90 miles per hour and the dry air and physical exertion means that climbers can soon become dehydrated and need to drink up to six litres of water each day. Also the amount of oxygen available to breathe drops with increasing altitude. At sea level the amount of oxygen in the air is about 21% with a pressure of 760 mmHg. As altitude increases the percentage remains the same but the pressure drops. At 3000m the pressure is 540 mmHg, at 5000m it is 420 mmHg and at the top of K2 can be as low as 253 mmHg. This means there are fewer oxygen molecules per breath so the breathing rate increases to try to get more oxygen into the blood. Another problem experienced by many climbers is . Low air pressure can cause fluid to leak from the capillaries in both the lungs and the brain. This results in a build-up of fluid. As the pressure drops and the fluid build up increases, the life-threatening condition of altitude sickness occurs. Name the process by which the body keeps a constant internal environment. What happens to the air pressure as climbers go up Mount Everest? What percentage of the air is oxygen at the top of K2? Describe two effects that high altitude can have on the human body. A climber stays close to the top of K2 for two days. How much fluid are they likely to drink? Explain what happens to the body temperature when hypothermia occurs at high altitude. Explain why breathing rate increases as climbers get to higher altitudes. To the nearest whole number, calculate the percentage of oxygen molecules available in each breath to a climber on top of K2 when compared to a person at sea level. Describe the effect of cold temperatures on the skin and body of climbers. Suggest what should be done for a climber that experiences altitude sickness. Thoroughly check your answers as marks will be awarded for correct spelling, punctuation and grammar. The process by which the body keeps a constant internal environment is called homeostasis. Air pressure gets less as altitude increases. 21% - it is the same as at sea level. You can have marks for any two from this list of the effects of high altitude : 12 litres (2 days x 6 litres = 12 litres) Intense cold causes the core body temperature to drop from 37ºC to below 35ºC. Less oxygen is available so breathing rate increases to get the oxygen into the blood. 33%. You need to work out air pressure at the top of K2 (253mmHg) as a percentage of pressure at sea level (760mmHg). (253 ÷ 760) × 100 = 33.289.... Sweating decreases, shivering occurs, blood vessels constrict, blood flow to skin is reduced which reduces energy loss. Supply the climber with oxygen and get the climber down to a safer altitude. "

70,2,"Experts scramble to keep this world-famous city from sinking. Venice attracts millions of tourists each year for its beautiful art and architecture. People weave their way through the city on boats because there are no streets. A maze of long or waterways, takes the place of roads. In fact, there are no cars or trucks in Venice. Venice is located in northern Italy on the Adriatic Sea. The city was built on a series of small islands in a or an area of shallow water. During some high tides, water floods the city. For hundreds of years, people have tried to keep water out of the city to save it from sinking. Now a group of scientists has introduced a bold plan to keep the city afloat. And it means adding more water! Venice is sinking at a rate of 1.57 inches per year, according to scientists. The Italian government has proposed the building of floodgates to control the flow of the sea. Scientists hope to turn the tide in favor of Venice. They want to pump huge amounts of water into the ground through sturdy pipes. Scientists expect the water will expand the sand underneath and prop up the city. They hope to test the project on a small area over the next few months. In Venice, a maze of long canals takes the place of roads. Scientists behind the plan say that the pipes will work along with the floodgates to help save the city. However, other scientists are not as convinced. They warn that the plan could cause parts of the city to crumble if the work isn’t carried out in a careful way. Everyone, however, agrees that saving the sinking city is important. ""If we let Venice fall into the sea, the world would lose tremendous part of [history],"" Melissa Conn of Save Venice, an organization dedicated to helping preserve the city, told reporters. Venice in Italian means ""city of canals."" About 1.6 million people live in Venice. The most famous building in Venice is the Basilica of St. Mark, a church dedicated to the patron saint of the city. measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.

72,2,"In late October, fountains of hot liquid rock burst from one of the most famous volcanoes in the world-Mount Etna. Mount Etna is located on the island of Sicily, which is part of Italy. Rivers of molten rock, or , flowed down the sides of the volcano, burning everything in its path. Some of superheated rivers of lava flowed toward towns. In an attempt to stop the advancing lava, airplanes dropped thousands of gallons on water on it. Fearing for their lives, many people fled from their homes. The volcano also shot thick flakes of hot ash into the sky. Much of the ash rained down on nearby towns. Some of it rose high into the atmosphere. Winds blew the ash up to 400 miles from the volcano. People in Sicily have lived with Mount Etna for a long time. The first recorded eruption happened about 3,500 years ago. Since then, Mount Etna has erupted more than 250 times. In 1669, an earthquake triggered by an eruption killed nearly 20,000 people. The volcano's last large eruption was in 1992. Scientists used explosives to move the rivers of lava away from towns.

74,4,"There are two opposing historic images of the Depression in 1930s Britain: - lines of broken, unemployed men, rows of shabby housing - and - new washing machines, automobiles, electricity and cinemas. In 1929, the Wall Street Crash plunged the USA into economic depression. The Americans were alarmed, so they called in their loans to other countries and put up customs barriers to stop imports of foreign goods. This created a depression across the rest of the world. Unemployment in Britain rose to 2.5 million (25 per cent of the workforce) in 1933. Worst hit were the areas of heavy industry (eg coal, iron, steel, shipbuilding) in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and the north of England. These industries were already struggling because they had not modernised after the war and had been badly affected by competition from other countries. The Depression meant that now these industries crumbled. For example, when the coal mine, the steel works and Palmer's shipyard closed down in Jarrow in the north-east of England, every single man in the town was made laid off from work because they are no longer needed The people of Jarrow organised a march to London - a crusade to seek help from the government, but they were told to go home and work out their own salvation'. In fact, the government did not have a clue how to cope with the Depression , and the policies it did put into action were either useless, or made matters worse. Key industries closed in Jarrow sparking the Jarrow Crusade. In the south-east of England where new such as chemicals, electrical goods and automobiles had been developed, . In fact, people with jobs benefited from the Depression because prices fell and they could buy more! of the Depression was the Wall Street Crash, but other factors also helped to create the Depression out of the Crash. To understand them, you need to understand that the of an economic depression is a reduction in spending, and that the way to end a depression is to get people to buy things: - Import duties discouraged trade, which harmed the economy. The reduction in trade particularly hit the shipbuilding and railway industries if there was no trade, there was no need for transport. - when there is unemployment and uncertainty, people cut back on spending and save 'for a rainy day'. This then makes businesses go bankrupt and causes the unemployment they feared. - unemployed people have no wage and cannot buy things, which causes more businesses to go bankrupt and creates more unemployment. Outdated practices - British heavy industry was out of date and labour-intensive. When orders dried up, the only way they could cope was to lay off workers. made the depression worse: - The increase in unemployment meant the government was faced with a vastly increased expenditure on benefits. So in 1931, it raised income tax and cut unemployment pay by 10 per cent and introduced the means test. These measures reduced the amount of money people had to spend and made the Depression worse. - The Import Duties Act (1932) was designed to protect British industry, but this merely reduced trade and made the Depression worse. Cutting unemployment pay by 10 per cent. Adding import duties to goods from abroad. Where the total currency in a country is equal in value to the amount of gold that the country owns. - this allowed the government to increase the amount of money in circulation. Reduced interest rates - this reduced people's debt payments and made more money available to spend, but also encouraged them to take out loans to spend more. The Special Areas Act (1934) - tried to attract light industries to the 'distressed' areas. Local councils built 500,000 council houses, which pumped money into the economy. Some people (especially in the south of England) become more Prices fell in the Depression, which meant more money for luxuries. Hire-purchase allowed people to get luxuries 'on the never-never'. Family size fell, which meant more money for luxuries. Improvements at work such as reduction in working hours, holidays with pay. Three million new houses were built in the 1930s. There was a 1200 per cent increase in homes with electricity. Better leisure such as cinema, dance halls, swimming baths and football matches. A better diet. Free school milk was introduced after 1934 Better health, which meant people were taller, fitter and heavier. Divide the facts in this topic into two lists - 'good things' and 'bad things' about the 1930s. As part of your revision, think about the there was a depression in the 1930s. Britain experienced a depression in the 1930s. the government dealt with the economic problems of the 1930s. "

""I've grown up in a house with a lot of antiques around,"" said Bingham, who was in fifth grade at the time he discovered the painting. ""I recognized it as something very old and very beautiful."" And he was right. It turns out that the piece, called , was painted in 1878 by Walter Crane, a British artist. It had been on loan to the school for nearly 70 years. Last summer, the painting was shipped to London. There, it sold at an auction for more than a half million dollars.

Some truths about God can be revealed through reason, conscience, the natural world, or moral sense. is direct revelation to an individual or a group. This sort of revelation includes dreams, visions, experience and prophecy. Muslims often use the phrase, ‘Peace be upon him’ (pbuh) after saying the name of a prophet of Islam as a sign of respect eg,' Prophet Muhammad (pbuh).' In Arabic these salutations are called . The phrase is abbreviated to SAW (Arabic) or PBUH (English). Scripture is the most important type of revelation for Muslims. The That which is read or recited. The Divine Book revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. Allah's final revelation to humankind. The Islamic name for God in the Arabic language . It was revealed to him in Arabic. The is therefore different from any other book for Muslims because it contains the words of Allah. In 611 CE the Prophet Muhammad was meditating in a cave when the Angel Jibril appeared to him. Muhammad could not read but three times Jibril ordered him to ‘recite’. The angel said: Proclaim! In the name of thy Lord and Cherisher, who created – created man, out of a (mere) clot of congealed blood. Proclaim! And thy Lord Is Most Bountiful! He who taught (the use of) the pen taught man that which he knew not. Jibril then told Muhammad that he was to be the . These revelations continued for the next 23 years and the final verse was: This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion. Muhammad remained unable to read and the (or chapters). These are arranged by length, not by chronological order. contains only the literal unchanged words of Allah. It is direct revelation from Allah (God) to humanity. Because the word of Allah it cannot be criticised . To do so would be seen as not only irrelevant but, most importantly, it would be Also to preserve the true words of God, the in other languages are not called translations because the true meaning of the words can only be found in the Arabic. The . It is the last and most complete book of guidance from Allah and applies to In his sermon on Mount Arafat, Muhammad made it clear that this was the final revelation: ""No prophet or messenger will come after me and no new faith will emerge."" The second most important source of authority for Muslims is the . This refers to the practices, customs and traditions of the that are considered to be a perfect example. They are found in Collection of authenticated reports of what Prophet Muhammad said, did or approved. while he was alive. These were later written down and scrutinised and then collections were made of them. Different groups of Muslims accept different collections of , Muslims can experience the way Muhammad explained and illustrated the teaching in the That which is read or recited. The Divine Book revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. Allah's final revelation to humankind. including the teaching about Allah. For example, the following might help a Muslim better understand the idea that Allah the Almighty has said: 'O son of Adam, so long as you call upon Me, and hope in Me, I shall forgive you for what you have done, and I shall not mind. O son of Adam, were your sins to reach the clouds in the sky and were you then to ask forgiveness of Me, I shall forgive you. O son of Adam, were you to come to Me with an earthful of sins and were you then to face Me, without having associated anything with Me, I shall grant you an earthful of pardon.' Miracles are not a major concern of Islam. There are examples of miracles recorded in the , in particular the Al-Mi‘raj when Muhammad was taken through the heavens to meet Allah. The makes clear that Allah can perform miracles if he wishes. The itself is sometimes seen as a living miracle because of the way in which it has been passed down unchanged. "

81,4,"An atom of any given element consists of a nucleus containing a number of protons and neutrons. The nucleus is surrounded by electrons. The half-life of a radioactive isotope is the time taken for half its radioactive atoms to decay. There are three main types of radiation, called radiation, which all have different properties. Radiation can damage cells and make them cancerous. Very high doses of radiation can kill cells. It can be detected using photographic film or a Geiger-Muller tube. Radiation badges are used to monitor the level of radiation that people who work with radioactive sources are exposed to. Radiation has many practical uses. It can be used in medicine to trace where certain chemicals collect in the body, indicating disease, and also in industry, where it can be used to control measuring equipment. . The protons and neutrons are found in the nucleus at the centre of the atom, and the electrons are arranged in energy levels or shells around the nucleus. All the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons and electrons. However, the number of neutrons can vary. Atoms of the same element that have different numbers of neutrons are called of that element. The diagram shows three hydrogen isotopes. The different isotopes of an element have identical chemical properties. Some isotopes, however, are radioactive. This means that they give out radiation from their nuclei. This happens all the time, whatever is done to the substance. For example, the radiation is still given out if the substance is cooled down in a freezer, or takes part in a chemical reaction. There are three main types of radiation emitted from radioactive atoms. These are alpha, beta and gamma radiation. . An alpha particle is identical to the nucleus of a helium atom, which comprises two protons and two neutrons. emitted from the nucleus. These electrons have not come from the electron shells or energy levels around the nucleus. Instead, they form when a neutron splits into a proton and an electron. The electron then shoots out of the nucleus at high speed. short wavelength - high frequency - electromagnetic radiation . This is similar to other types of electromagnetic radiation such as visible light and X-rays, which can travel long distances. Radiation can be absorbed by substances in its path. For example, alpha radiation travels only a few centimetres in air, beta radiation travels tens of centimetres in air and gamma radiation travels many metres. All types of radiation become less intense the further the distance from the radioactive material, as the particles or rays become more spread out. The thicker the substance, the more the radiation is absorbed. The three types of radiation penetrate materials in different ways. . It can be stopped - or absorbed - by just a sheet of paper. . It can be stopped by a thin sheet of aluminium. . Even small levels can penetrate air, paper or thin metal. Higher levels can only be stopped by many centimetres of lead or many metres of concrete.

Alpha particles are positively charged, beta particles are negatively charged and gamma radiation is electrically neutral. This means that alpha radiation and beta radiation can be deflected by electric fields, but gamma radiation is not deflected. Remember that opposite charges attract. Beta particles are negatively charged so they will be attracted towards a positively charged plate. And positive alpha particles will be attracted towards a negatively charged plate.

Human senses cannot detect radiation, so we need equipment to do this. Photographic film goes darker when it absorbs radiation, just like it does when it absorbs visible light. The more radiation the film absorbs, the darker it is when it is developed. , which are checked regularly to monitor the levels of radiation absorbed. The diagram shows a typical radiation badge when it is closed and what the inside looks like when it is opened. There is a light-proof packet of photographic film inside the badge. The more radiation this absorbs, the darker it becomes when it is developed. To get an accurate measure of the dose received, the badge contains different materials that the radiation must penetrate to reach the film. These may include aluminium, copper, lead-tin alloy and plastic. There is also an open area at the centre of the badge. The Geiger-Muller tube detects radiation. Each time it absorbs radiation, it transmits an electrical pulse to a counting machine. This makes a clicking sound or displays the count rate. The greater the frequency of clicks, or the higher the count rate, the more radiation the Geiger-Muller tube is absorbing. Check your understanding of this topic by having a go at the activity.

When radiation collides with molecules in living cells it can damage them. If the DNA in the nucleus of a cell is damaged, the cell may become cancerous. The cell then goes out of control, divides rapidly and causes serious health problems. The greater the dose of radiation a cell gets, the greater the chance that the cell will become cancerous. However, very high doses of radiation can kill the cell completely. We use this property of radiation to kill cancer cells, and also harmful bacteria and other micro-organisms. The hazard symbol is shown on containers of radioactive substances to warn of the danger. The degree to which each different type of radiation is most dangerous to the body depends on whether the source is outside or inside the body. If the radioactive source is inside the body , perhaps after being swallowed or breathed in: because it is easily absorbed by cells. Beta and gamma radiation are not as dangerous because they are less likely to be absorbed by a cell and will usually just pass right through it. If the radioactive source is outside the body Alpha radiation is not as dangerous because it is unlikely to reach living cells inside the body. because they can penetrate the skin and damage the cells inside. Notice that these effects are opposites and make sure you get them the right way around. The nuclei of radioactive atoms are unstable. They break down and change into a completely different type of atom. This is called radioactive decay. For example, It is not possible to predict when an individual atom might decay. But it is possible to measure how long it takes for half the nuclei of a piece of radioactive material to decay. This is called the half-life of the radioactive isotope. There are two definitions of half-life, but they mean essentially the same thing: the time it takes for the number of nuclei of the isotope in a sample to halve the time it takes for the count rate from a sample containing the isotope to fall to half its starting level Different radioactive isotopes have different half-lives. For example, the half-life of carbon-14 is 5,715 years, but the half-life of francium-223 is just 20 minutes. It is possible to find out the half-life of a radioactive substance from a graph of the count rate against time. The graph shows the decay curve for a radioactive substance. The decay curve for a radioactive substance The count rate drops from 80 to 40 counts a minute in two days, so the half-life is two days. In the next two days, it drops from 40 to 20 - it halves. In the two days after that, it drops from 20 to 10 - it halves again - and so on. Here are some examples of how radiation is used: for dating rocks and materials such as archaeological finds in chemical tracers to help with medical diagnosis for measuring the thickness of materials in, for example, a paper factory Doctors may use radioactive chemicals called tracers for medical imaging. Certain chemicals concentrate in different damaged or diseased parts of the body, and the radiation concentrates with it. Radiation detectors placed outside the body detect the radiation emitted and, with the aid of computers, build up an image of the inside of the body. When a radioactive chemical is used in this way it is not normally harmful, because: it has a short half-life and so decays before it can do much damage Emitters of beta radiation or gamma radiation are used because these types of radiation readily pass out of the body, and they are less likely to be absorbed by cells than alpha radiation. Radiation is used in industry in detectors that monitor and control the thickness of materials such as paper, plastic and aluminium. The thicker the material, the more radiation is absorbed and the less radiation reaches the detector. It then sends signals to the equipment that adjusts the thickness of the material.

83,4,"Making decisions on moral issues is not easy. Religion helps followers to make decisions that are pleasing to God and create a society where people respect and care for each other People draw on a variety of sources of authority to help them make a decision. For example: religious leaders and the official teaching of their religion There are two types of morality that affect the decisions people make – absolute morality and relative moraility. If you believe in absolute morality you will have faith that there is a right course of action to take in a moral dilemma, which is true in all situations regardless of culture, religious tradition, time or age. How would a follower of this sort of morality respond to the commandment ‘Do not kill’? They would try to make sure that they were not involved in any killing, which would affect their views on issues such as war, abortion and euthanasia. They would say that these actions are wrong in all circumstances. If you believe in relative morality you would agree that different courses of action might be needed in different situations. How would a follower of this sort of morality respond to the commandment ‘Do not kill’? They would agree that killing is wrong, but would look at a range of other issues as well and say that sometimes killing might be necessary in a particular situation, such as abortion, if continuing the pregnancy would result in the birth of a very disabled child, or if the mother had been raped. Contraception or ‘birth control’ is used for a variety of reasons: when pregnancy might harm the mental or physical condition of the mother to limit the number of children people have to ensure they don't damage living standards or affect other children to prevent pregnancy in people who do not want a child at this stage in their lives There are no rules in Sikhism against the use of contraceptives. Sikhism teaches that couples should decide whether they use family planning and what method they should use. However, natural methods of contraception are generally preferred to artificial methods and devices. Contraception may be seen as necessary for health of the partners or the upbringing of existing children. Abortion is the artificial ending of the life of a foetus in the womb (uterus). A natural abortion is called a miscarriage. Abortion has been legal in England, Scotland and Wales since 1967 when The Abortion Act was passed. A new upper time limit of 24 weeks was introduced in 1990 under The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act. An abortion may be carried out if one of the following conditions applies: the life or physical health of the mother is at risk the mental health of the mother is at risk there is a reasonable chance that the child will be born seriously disabled Where the mental health of the mother is at risk, or her family will suffer if the pregnancy continues, the latest termination date is 24 weeks. There is no upper limit if the life or physical health of the mother is at risk, or if there is a reasonable chance of a seriously disabled child being born. In 1974 119,000 legal abortions were carried out in England and Wales, by 2006 this figure had risen to 193,700. Sikhs believe that human life begins at conception. They also believe that all human beings are created by O, my body, God infused divine light in you and you were born into the world. Central to Sikhism is the belief that God is the destroyer, preserver and creator. Therefore, everything that has life is sacred. For this reason, Sikhs cannot morally allow an abortion to take place even if there is a definite chance of the unborn child being severely mentally or physically handicapped. The only circumstances when abortion might be regarded as acceptable if the pregnancy was a result of rape, or, as in other faiths, if the mother’s life is at risk during pregnancy. In the first watch of the night, O my merchant friend, you were cast into the womb, by the Lord's Command. Upside-down, within the womb, you performed penance, O my merchant friend, and you prayed to your Lord and Master. You uttered prayers to your Lord and Master, while upside-down, and you meditated on Him with deep love and affection. You came into this Dark Age of Kali Yuga naked, and you shall depart again naked. As God's Pen has written on your forehead, so it shall be with your soul.

""What has us really worried is that many frog species are disappearing, and we don't know why,"" museum scientist Taran Grant told . Experts say disease or pollution may be to blame. However, no one really knows for sure. ""We had two goals in putting together this exhibit,"" said Grant. ""One goal was to expose people to the variety of frogs in the world. The other was to teach people about the threats to their survival."" Frogs have been on Earth for millions of years. They were alive when dinosaurs roamed the planet.

88,3,"A sentence is made up of words put together to do a certain job. Let's take a look at what those pieces are and how they fit together to make a sentence. First, we have words. Words are the smallest meaningful bits of sense. Each of these words does a different job. is a verb - it tells us what happens in a sentence. is a noun - it names things in a sentence. is an adjective - it gives us more detail about a noun. We put words together to make a A phrase is a short, single piece of information: We use phrases to make a clause. A clause is a larger word group that includes a little more information. It consists at least two phrases - one is a noun phrase known as the subject, and the other is the verb. In this clause, the noun phrase is This now takes us to the sentence. If we put a capital letter at the beginning of the clause we've used, and a full stop at the end, we have a sentence. . A simple sentence consists of one clause that has a subject and a verb. A simple sentence puts across one simple idea. A complex sentence is used to put across more ideas. A complex sentence contains one main clause that can make sense on its own, and one or more minor clauses that are linked to it. The main clause is the 'big dog barked' because it has a subject and a verb and makes sense by itself. The minor clause is 'When I arrived'. Although it is a clause with a subject and a verb, it doesn't make sense on its own, it needs a main clause. We can add more minor clauses to make a more complex sentence. We can even split the main clause with a minor clause and still have a complex sentence. Whack and zap mad professors and aliens! Love books? Get your reviews published on Student Life.

Humans produce these, too, but they also produce other waste materials. These materials can pollute the environment. They include: Rubbish is taken to a landfill site Rubbish does not vanish when it is thrown away. A lot of it is buried in sites. These may be disused quarries or rough ground that cannot be used for farming or housing. When landfill sites are full of rubbish, they are covered in soil and planted with trees and bushes. rubbish is important because fewer landfill sites are needed, and the materials in the rubbish are re-used. Fertilisers are chemicals used by farmers to help their crops grow well. Rain can wash fertilizers off the fields and into rivers. This causes water plants to overgrow and block out the light. Other plants die as a result. They use up oxygen as they rot away, and fish and other animals suffocate. This process is called eutrophication. Smoke from burning fuels makes buildings turn black. With other waste chemicals in the air, it can form smog. This makes the air hazy, especially over large towns and cities. The polluted air can make it difficult to breathe. are produced when fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas burn. Sulfur dioxide dissolves in the clouds and causes acid rain.

92,4,"All matter is made of atoms. There are over a hundred different types of atom, called elements, and each one has a symbol. The atoms of a particular element are identical to each other. When atoms of different elements join together they make a compound. Compounds are represented by formulae that show how many atoms of each element are in the compound. Formulae can be worked out from the charge of the ions that make up the compound. Chemical reactions can be written down as balanced chemical equations. All matter is made from atoms. Atoms are very, very small. A molecule is formed when atoms join together by chemical bonds. There are over a hundred different types of atom, called elements. The atoms of a particular element are identical to each other. They cannot be changed chemically into any different element. For example a piece of pure sulfur consists only of sulfur atoms. No chemical process can break it down into a different substance. Compounds are substances that contain atoms of at least chemically combined. For example: magnesium oxide consists of magnesium atoms and oxygen atoms chemically bonded together. Notice how the name sometimes suggests whether a substance is an element or a compound. If you can see the names of two or more elements it's almost certainly a compound but beware – many substances with only one name are actually compounds – water and methane for example. Elements are represented by one or two . The first letter is always a capital and the second is always lower case. . Symbols and numbers show the atoms in the compound. One zinc atom (Zn) and one carbon atom (C) are chemically bonded with three oxygen atoms (O ). Notice that we don't need to write a 1 next to the Zn or C. Iron(III) hydroxide consists of one iron atom joined with three oxygen and three hydrogen atoms. The formula is written like this because the oxygen and hydrogen atom often act together. The formula of a compound can usually be deduced if the in it are known. For example, the compound formed from Na ion so that the compound is neutral overall. The formula is therefore Na It's helpful to remember some of the common ions so that the formula of most compounds can be deduced. When the atoms in elements or compounds rearrange themselves to form new substances it's called a . The atoms are rearranged but no atoms are lost or made. Chemical reactions are written down as chemical When copper is heated in the air it reacts with the oxygen to form a new substance, called This is not the whole story. A chemical equation needs to show where all the atoms in the products have come from. It also needs to account for all the atoms in all of the reactants. To the equation, adjust the number of atoms or molecules until there are the same numbers of each type of atom on both sides of the equation. Don't be tempted to change the formulae of any of the substances involved. What is the equation for the above reaction? The substances involved are copper atoms (Cu), oxygen molecules in the air (O ) and molecules of copper oxide (CuO). If we use them to write the equation it might not be balanced. It would look like this: But that is not a balanced equation. This cannot be completely correct because there are two atoms of oxygen on the left and only one on the right. One atom of oxygen is We balance it by thinking about the atoms and molecules involved. Two atoms of copper are needed for every molecule of oxygen. Two atoms of copper react with two atoms of oxygen to form two molecules of copper oxide "

This process is called Over time, as the unstable atoms in a source of radiation change, the activity of the source goes down because there are fewer unstable atoms present to decay. It is not possible to predict when an individual atom might decay, but you can measure how long it takes for half the atoms to decay. This is called the There are two definitions of a half-life, but they mean essentially the same thing: The time it takes for the number of atoms in a sample to halve. The time it takes for the activity of a source of radiation to fall to half its starting level. Different radioactive isotopes and types of radioactive material have different half-lives. For example, the half-life of is nearly 6000 years, but the half-life of It is possible to find out the half-life of a radioactive substance from a graph showing the count rate against time. The graph shows the The decay curve for a radioactive substance The count rate drops from 80 to 40 counts per minute in two days. So the half-life is two days. In the next two days, it drops from 40 to 20, ie it halves. In the two days after that, it drops from 20 to 10, ie it halves again, and so on. Read on if you are taking the An atom is the smallest part of an element that still has the properties of that element, comprising electrons surrounding a nucleus of protons and neutrons. of a given element have the same number of Sub-atomic particles with a positive charge and a relative mass of 1. Uncharged sub-atomic particles, with a mass of 1 relative to a proton. can vary. Atoms of the same element that have different numbers of neutrons are called of that element. The diagram shows three hydrogen isotopes. When an atom emits alpha or beta radiation, its The central part of an atom. It contains protons and neutrons, and has most of the mass of the atom. changes. It becomes the nucleus of a different element. This is because the number of protons in the nucleus determines which element the atom belongs to. These are the changes that occur to the number of protons in an unstable nucleus when it emits a radioactive particle: alpha particle - the number of protons goes down by two beta particle - the number of protons increases by one In each case, a different element is left behind.

Recently, several African-American leaders were appointed to help manage the project. They include talk-show host Oprah Winfrey and Robert Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television (BET). The museum will be part of the Smithsonian Institution. Although its exact location has not yet been determined, officials hope that it may find a home on the National Mall. The U.S. government is paying for about half the museum's $400 million cost. The museum's leaders will help raise the rest of the money. President George W. Bush authorizes the creation of a Smithsonian museum dedicated to African-American history and culture. The museum will celebrate the contributions of African Americans in the United States. It will highlight African-American history and culture from the Civil War (1860-1865) to the present. ""I look forward to the day the National Museum [of African-American history] opens and I can take my children and grandchildren to not only see history but be part of it,"" said one of the committee members.

103,4,"Crude oil is a mixture of compounds called hydrocarbons. Many useful materials can be produced from crude oil. It can be separated into different fractions using fractional distillation, and some of these can be used as fuels. Unfortunately, there are environmental consequences when fossil fuels such as crude oil and its products are used. Most of the compounds in crude oil are hydrocarbons. This means that they only contain hydrogen and carbon atoms, joined together by chemical bonds. There are different types of hydrocarbon, but most of the ones in crude oil are alkanes. The alkanes are a family of hydrocarbons that share the same general formula. This is: The general formula means that the number of hydrogen atoms in an alkane is double the number of carbon atoms, plus two. For example, methane is CH . Alkane molecules can be represented by displayed formulae in which each atom is shown as its symbol ( ) and the chemical bonds between them by a straight line. Notice that the molecular models on the right show that the bonds are not really at 90º. Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons. This means that their carbon atoms are joined to each other by single bonds. This makes them relatively unreactive, apart from their reaction with oxygen in the air, which we call burning or combustion. Boiling point and state at room temperature Hydrocarbons have different boiling points, and can be either solid, liquid or gas at room temperature: Small hydrocarbons with only a few carbon atoms have low boiling points and are gases. Hydrocarbons with between five and 12 carbon atoms are usually liquids. Large hydrocarbons with many carbon atoms have high boiling points and are solids. Distillation is a process that can be used to separate a pure liquid from a mixture of liquids. It works when the liquids have different boiling points. Distillation is commonly used to separate ethanol (the alcohol in alcoholic drinks) from water Distillation process to separate ethanol from water Step 1 - water and ethanol solution are heated Distillation process to separate ethanol from water Step 2 - the ethanol evaporates first, cools, then condenses Distillation process to separate ethanol from water Step 3 - the water left evaporates, cools, then condenses The mixture is heated in a flask. Ethanol has a lower boiling point than water so it evaporates first. The ethanol vapour is then cooled and condensed inside the condenser to form a pure liquid. The thermometer shows the boiling point of the pure ethanol liquid. When all the ethanol has evaporated from the solution, the temperature rises and the water evaporates. This is the sequence of events in distillation: heating → evaporating → cooling → condensing Fractional distillation differs from distillation only in that it separates a mixture into a . A tall column is fitted above the mixture, with several condensers coming off at different heights. The column is hot at the bottom and cool at the top. Substances with high boiling points condense at the bottom and substances with low boiling points condense at the top. Like distillation, fractional distillation works because the different substances in the mixture have different boiling points. Because they have different boiling points, the substances in crude oil can be separated using fractional distillation. The crude oil is evaporated and its vapours allowed to condense at different temperatures in the fractionating column. Each fraction contains hydrocarbon molecules with a similar number of carbon atoms. The diagram below summarises the main fractions from crude oil and their uses, and the trends in properties. Note that the gases condense at the top of the column, the liquids in the middle and the solids stay at the bottom. The main fractions include refinery gases, gasoline (petrol), naphtha, kerosene, diesel oil, fuel oil, and a residue that contains bitumen. These fractions are mainly used as fuels, although they do have other uses too. Hydrocarbons with small molecules make better fuels than hydrocarbons with large molecules because they are volatile, flow easily and are easily ignited. Fuels burn when they react with oxygen in the air. The hydrogen in hydrocarbons is oxidised to water (remember that water, H O, is an oxide of hydrogen). If there is plenty of air, we get complete combustion and the carbon in hydrocarbons is oxidised to carbon dioxide: hydrocarbon + oxygen    →    water + carbon dioxide If there is insufficient air for complete combustion, we get incomplete combustion instead. The hydrogen is still oxidised to water, but instead of carbon dioxide we get carbon monoxide. Particles of carbon, seen as soot or smoke, are also released. Most hydrocarbon fuels naturally contain some sulfur compounds. When the fuel burns, the sulfur it contains is oxidised to sulfur dioxide. Clouds of smoke and other combustion products are emitted from chimneys The combustion of a fuel may release several gases into the atmosphere, including: These products may be harmful to the environment. Sulfur dioxide is produced when fuels that contain sulfur compounds burn. It is a gas with a sharp, choking smell. When sulfur dioxide dissolves in water droplets in clouds, it makes the rain more acidic than normal. This is called Acid rain reacts with metals and rocks such as limestone. Buildings and statues are damaged as a result. Acid rain damages the waxy layer on the leaves of trees and makes it more difficult for trees to absorb the minerals they need for healthy growth. They may die as a result. Acid rain also makes rivers and lakes too acidic for some aquatic life to survive. Sulfur dioxide can be removed from waste gases after combustion of the fuel. This happens in power stations. The sulfur dioxide is treated with powdered limestone to form calcium sulfate. This can be used to make plasterboard for lining interior walls, so turning a harmful product into a useful one. Sulfur can be removed from fuels at the oil refinery. This makes the fuel more expensive to produce, but it prevents sulfur dioxide being produced. You may have noticed 'low sulfur' petrol and diesel on sale at filling stations. Carbon dioxide from burning fuels causes global warming, a process capable of changing the world’s climate significantly. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen at a higher rate since the 19th century The temperature of the earth has risen over the years As you can see from the graphs, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased steadily over the past 150 years, and so has the average global temperature. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. It absorbs heat energy and prevents it escaping from the Earth’s surface into space. The greater the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the more heat energy is absorbed and the hotter the Earth becomes. Heat is reflected back from the Earth’s surface Heat is absorbed by carbon dioxide (greenhouse gas) and as a result becomes trapped in the Earth’s atmosphere The Earth becomes hotter as a result A rise of just a few degrees in world temperatures will have a dramatic impact on the climate: Global weather patterns will change, causing drought in some places and flooding in others. Melting of polar ice caps will raise sea levels, causing increased coastal erosion and flooding of low-lying land – including land where major cities lie. The Triftgletscher glacier, Switzerland, 2003. As the glacier melts further, the lake's water level rises. Tiny particles that are released when fuels are burned cause global dimming. Like global warming, this process may change rainfall patterns around the world. The amount of sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface has decreased by about 2 per cent every ten years, because more sunlight is being reflected back into space. The particles from burning fuels reflect sunlight, and they also cause more water droplets to form in the clouds. This makes the clouds better at reflecting sunlight back into space. It is likely that global dimming has hidden some of the effects of global warming, by stopping some of the Sun’s energy reaching the Earth’s surface in the first place. Governments around the world are introducing controls on pollution. There is the possibility that as the air becomes less polluted by smoke and soot, global dimming will decrease, causing the effects of global warming to become more obvious. "

106,4,"Heat can be transferred from place to place by The transfer of heat energy through a material - without the material itself moving. The transfer of heat energy through a moving liquid or gas. Electromagnetic radiation emitted from a hot object. . Dark matt surfaces are better at absorbing heat energy than light shiny surfaces. Heat energy can be lost from homes in many different ways and there are ways of reducing these heat losses. There are several different types of energy, and these can be transferred from one type to another. Energy transfer diagrams show the energy transfers in a process. More efficient devices transfer the energy supplied to them into a greater proportion of useful energy than less efficient devices do. Heat is thermal energy. It can be transferred from one place to another by conduction, convection and radiation. Conduction and convection involve particles, but radiation involves electromagnetic waves. Thermogram of a pan being heated on a stove Heat energy can move through a substance by conduction. , but non-metals and gases are usually poor conductors of heat. Poor conductors of heat are called insulators. Heat energy is conducted from the hot end of an object to the cold end. The electrons in piece of metal can leave their atoms and move about in the metal as free electrons. The parts of the metal atoms left behind are now charged metal ions. The ions are packed closely together and they vibrate continually. The hotter the metal, the more kinetic energy these vibrations have. This kinetic energy is transferred from hot parts of the metal to cooler parts by the free electrons. These move through the structure of the metal, colliding with ions as they go. Liquids and gases are fluids. The particles in these fluids can move from place to place. Convection occurs when particles with a lot of heat energy in a liquid or gas move and take the place of particles with less heat energy. Heat energy is transferred from hot places to cooler places by convection. Liquids and gases expand when they are heated . This is because the particles in liquids and gases move faster when they are heated than they do when they are cold. As a result, the particles take up more volume. This is because the gap between particles widens, while the particles themselves stay the same size. The liquid or gas in hot areas is less dense than the liquid or gas in cold areas, so it rises into the cold areas. The denser cold liquid or gas falls into the warm areas. In this way, that transfer heat from place to place are set up. Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment. For information on how to enable JavaScript please go to the You will not be able to see this content until you have JavaScript switched on. All objects give out and take in . The hotter an object is, the more infrared radiation it emits. Infrared radiation is a type of electromagnetic radiation that involves waves. No particles are involved, unlike in the processes of conduction and convection, so radiation can even work through the vacuum of space. This is why we can still feel the heat of the Sun, although it is 150 million km away from the Earth. Some surfaces are better than others at reflecting and absorbing infrared radiation. Comparison of surfaces abilities to reflect and absorb radiation If two objects made from the same material have identical volumes, a thin, flat object will radiate heat energy faster than a fat object. This is one reason why domestic radiators are thin and flat. Radiators are often painted with white gloss paint. They would be better at radiating heat if they were painted with black matt paint, but in fact, despite their name, radiators transfer most of their heat to a room by convection. You should be able to describe how heat energy is lost from buildings and to explain how these losses can be reduced. Take a look at this image showing heat loss from a house. red shows where most heat is lost - through the windows and roof Heat energy is transferred from homes by The transfer of heat energy through a material - without the material itself moving. through the walls, floor, roof and windows. It is also transferred from homes by The transfer of heat energy through a moving liquid or gas. . For example, cold air can enter the house through gaps in doors and windows, and convection currents can transfer heat energy in the loft to the roof tiles. Heat energy also leaves the house by radiation through the walls, roof and windows. There are some simple ways to reduce heat loss, including fitting carpets, curtains and draught excluders. Heat loss through windows can be reduced using double glazing. The gap between the two panes of glass is filled with air. Heat loss through conduction is reduced, as air is a poor conductor of heat. Heat transfer by convection currents is also reduced by making the gap is very narrow. You may wish to view this BBC News item from 2006 about energy efficiency in homes. Heat loss through walls can be reduced using cavity wall insulation. This involves blowing insulating material into the gap between the brick and the inside wall, which reduces the heat loss by conduction. The material also prevents air circulating inside the cavity, therefore reducing heat loss by convection. Heat loss through the roof can be reduced by laying loft insulation. This works in a similar way to cavity wall insulation. You should be able to recognise the main types of energy. One way to remember the different types of energy is to learn this sentence: Each capital letter is the first letter in the name of a type of energy. The energy in moving objects. Also called movement energy. Stored energy in fuel, foods and batteries Energy in moving or static electric charges Stored energy in stretched or squashed objects studies how to draw and interpret an energy transfer diagram. Different types of energy can be transferred from one type to another. Energy transfer diagrams show each type of energy, whether it is stored or not, and the processes taking place as it is transferred. Sankey diagrams also show the relative amounts of each type of energy. This energy transfer diagram shows the useful energy transfer in a car engine. You can see that a car engine transfers , which is stored in the fuel, into This diagram shows the energy transfer diagram for the useful energy transfer in an electric lamp. You can see that the electric lamp transfers or converts Notice that these energy transfer diagrams only show the useful energy transfers. However, car engines are also noisy and hot, and electric lamps also give out Sankey diagrams summarise all the energy transfers taking place in a process. The thicker the line or arrow, the greater the amount of energy involved. The Sankey diagram for an electric lamp below shows that most of the electrical energy is transferred as heat rather than light. You should know that energy can be 'wasted' during energy transfers, and you should be able to calculate the The fraction of the energy supplied to a device which is transferred in a useful form. Energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be transferred from one form to another or moved. Energy that is 'wasted', like the heat energy from an electric lamp, does not disappear. Instead, it is transferred into the surroundings and spreads out so much that it becomes very difficult to do anything useful with it. Ordinary electric lamps contain a thin metal filament that glows when electricity passes through it. However, most of the electrical energy is transferred as heat energy instead of light energy. This is the Sankey diagram for a typical filament lamp. Modern energy-saving lamps work in a different way. They transfer a greater proportion of electrical energy as light energy. This is the Sankey diagram for a typical energy-saving lamp. Sankey diagram for a typical energy-saving lamp From the diagram, you can see that much less electrical energy is transferred, or 'wasted', as heat energy. The efficiency of a device such as a lamp can be calculated using this equation: efficiency = ( useful energy transferred ÷ energy supplied ) × 100 The efficiency of the filament lamp is (10 ÷ 100) × 100 = 10%. This means that 10% of the electrical energy supplied is transferred as light energy (90% is transferred as heat energy). The efficiency of the energy-saving lamp is (75 ÷ 100) × 100 = 75%. This means that 75% of the electrical energy supplied is transferred as light energy (25% is transferred as heat energy). Note that the efficiency of a device will always be less than 100%. "
107,4,"Most of the world’s religions have produced theories as to how the world was created and how people and animals came to be here. Usually these take the form of creation stories in the sacred books of the religions concerned. (the Divine Book revealed to the Prophet Muhammad) there are details of the Creation: Surely, your Lord is Allah. Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods; then He settled Himself on the Throne. He makes the night cover the day, pursuing it swiftly. He has created the sun and the moon and the stars, all made subservient by His command… He it is Who sends the winds… Good land brings forth vegetation plentifully by the command of the Lord. I have created men, high and low, that they may worship Me. I desire no support from them, nor do I desire that they should feed Me. Surely, it is Allah who is the Great Sustainer, the Lord of Power, the Strong. There is no particular order given for the Creation and there is no suggestion as to how long the One of the theories put forward by cosmologists is the . This suggests that about 15,000 million years ago there was a massive explosion. This was the point at which all matter in the universe began; space and time began then too. Over time the universe that we know, and human and animal life, emerged. This theory is generally accepted by scientists as being the best theory they have to explain the If this theory is true, then it could mean that the universe ‘ ’ and that it did not emerge as a result of the activity of a creator God. The idea that life might have evolved was first mentioned as early as the 4th century CE by , who wrote that God probably only created very simple life forms and that these developed over time. Today we associate evolutionary science with scientists such as who wrote ‘On the Origin of Species’ in 1859. He argued that life begin with very simple cells and later developed into what we see today. He said that was one of the major mechanisms driving evolution. Darwin upset many people with his views and even some respected scientists such as argued that the fossils which were discovered in the ground had been placed there by God deliberately to fool people. Muslims would argue that science does not affect their belief in Allah’s (God's) creation of the world, instead it explains what the That which is read or recited. The Divine Book revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. Allah's final revelation to humankind. does not say. An important part of being a Muslim is to strive for clear understanding, therefore scientific explanations are welcomed as they help Muslims to have a greater understanding of Allah. has an account of the beginning of Creation which appears Do not the disbelievers realise that the heavens and earth were a solid mass, then We split them asunder, and We made from water every living thing? … He it is Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon each gliding freely in its orbit. Because of the Muslim interest in and respect for science which helps them come to know and understand more about Allah, ideas from cosmology and evolutionary biology do not cause any problems. "
108,2,"History is getting ready to repeat itself. This summer, the Olympic Games will return to their birthplace--Greece. This year's Summer Olympics will take place from August 13 through August 29 in Athens, the capital of Greece. The Summer Games are held every four years. ""This Olympic homecoming will be an opportunity to reawaken the true spirit and meaning of the Olympic Games,"" said an Athens organizing committee member. The Olympic Games date back more than 2,700 years. They were first held in Olympia, an area west of Athens. The first known Olympic competition included just one event-a 200-yard footrace. Winning athletes were crowned with a wreath of olive leaves. Over the years, more events were added, such as wrestling, discus throwing, and chariot racing. As times changed, the Olympics evolved. In 1896, the first modern Olympic Games began in Athens. At that time, 312 athletes from 13 countries competed in nine sports. Now, more than a century later, 10,500 athletes from more than 200 countries will go for the gold. The athletes will compete in 28 events, including baseball, gymnastics, swimming, and tennis. Since 1896, the Olympic Games have journeyed around the world and have been by, or held in, many cities. In keeping with tradition, the Olympic torch was , or lit, this March in an ancient stadium in Olympia. , or worldwide, Olympic Torch Relay. It is the first time in history that the Olympic torch will journey through all continents except Antarctica. The torch will travel nearly 48,000 miles before reaching the opening ceremonies in Athens. As runners carry the torch around the world, people in Athens are having a race of their own. They are busy preparing for the estimated 5.3 million , or viewers, who are expected to flood the city in August. Construction workers are feverishly working to finish building the . Those are the places where Olympic athletes will compete in different events. At press time, the roof still had to be put on the Olympic Stadium. That is the site where the opening and closing ceremonies will be held. It is also where track-and-field events will take place. Around the rest of the city, workers are completing a railway system and tearing up narrow roads to widen them for traffic. Hotels and restaurants are getting ready for an influx of tourists. Topping the Olympic planners' list is making sure the city is secure for athletes and visitors. Some people are concerned that Athens might not be ready for the Olympics. But the Greek government was quick to reassure: ""We will have everything ready when it matters. We will offer what the world expects of us."" - The first modern Olympics are held in Athens, Greece. - Women compete for the first time. - Gold, silver, and bronze medals are awarded for the first time. - The first Winter Olympics are held, and the Olympic flame is introduced. - Female athletes from Afghanistan will compete for the first time.

111,0,"Imagine having to quit school to help your family earn money. Or think about what it might be like to be in a class with 49 other students and only one teacher. Kids in some countries must deal with problems like those. But a special worldwide organization is trying to help them. UNICEF helps children around the world. One way it helps is by providing schools and supplies. Three of the countries where UNICEF helps with education are Colombia, in South America, Rwanda (ruh-WAHN-duh), in Africa, and Thailand (TIGH-land), in Southeast Asia. Those countries are probably far from where you live. Have you ever wondered what it might be like to go to school in another country? In Colombia, the government requires kids to go to school for at least five years. Some people are poor and must work hard to survive. Some children must quit school to help their parents earn money. With UNICEF's help, Colombia's government is creating a special school for those children. The students learn at their own pace and attend when they can. They have a small library and a garden where they grow vegetables. One or two teachers must teach all the students, from grades 1 through 5. Students of the same age work together in small groups, helping one another learn. Children in Rwanda must go to school from ages 7 to 15. But there is not enough space in some schools in Rwanda to fit all the students. Some students cannot afford to buy the uniforms and notebooks they must have to go to school. To help solve those problems, UNICEF has created a special program called Schools-in-a-Box. Each box contains school supplies, workbooks, and learning games. When teachers use the Schools-in-a-Box, kids can be taught wherever they are. Children in Thailand must go to school for six years. Though school is free, some families cannot afford to buy the uniforms children must wear to school. Some classrooms in Thailand have as many as 50 kids and only one teacher! Often, children of all ages are in the same grade. The children must share the few books and school supplies that are in the school. But UNICEF is working to help these people. The organization has built Village Education Centers in parts of Thailand. At night, adults gather there and take classes. During the day, the buildings are schools for children. UNICEF is an organization that works to help children all over the world. UNICEF tries to provide health care, nutritious food, clean water, and an education for all children. The organization raises money and talks to world governments about helping children.

119,2,"As the clock ticks down toward Thanksgiving, the Macy's Parade Studio buzzes with activity. The sounds of saws, drills, and hammers echo through the former Tootsie Roll factory in New Jersey. The workers have no time to spare. I'm getting a sneak preview as they prepare for the 77th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City. More than 2 million people will line the parade route. Another 60 million people will watch on TV. I meet with John Piper and his talented team, who produce every detail of the huge parade. Piper is in charge of the studio. His crew designs and builds the floats and giant balloons that appear in the parade. The 2003 Macy's parade lineup features 15 giant helium balloons and 27 smaller balloons. Also included will be 29 floats, some of which contain cold-air balloons called ""falloons."" Ten marching bands and 30 groups of clowns will spice up the festivities. ""We don't do anything small,"" Piper tells me. The first giant balloon to fly in the Macy's parade was Felix the Cat, in 1927. The parade has featured 170 giant balloons in its history. No more than 15 balloons are used each year. Kermit the Frog stretches 78 feet, making it the longest balloon in this year's parade. A record six different Snoopy character balloons have appeared in the parade over the years. In 1957, a massive downpour caused the Popeye balloon to dump gallons of water on spectators below. To prove his point, Piper leads me up two flights of stairs. Here, Macy's balloon experts-called ""balloonatics""-work their magic. In one area hang models of the parade's newest giant balloons. The balloons include ""Strike Up the Band"" Barney, Sesame Street's Super Grover, and an all-new Garfield. Garfield has flown in 15 Macy's parades, but this year he will have a friend-his teddy bear, Pooky. In a large room next door, I watch as Piper checks the 49-foot-long Garfield balloon for leaks. On Thanksgiving morning, more than 50 Macy's ""handlers"" will steer the balloon 2.5 miles along the skyscraper-lined streets of New York City. Downstairs, head painter Beth Lucas puts the final touches on an 8-foot-tall eagle. The giant bronze bird will be at the center of the ""Spirit of America"" float. Nearby, other workers hammer away from atop a wooden frame that will become the ""Bridge to the Future"" float. The float will feature the newest Hess toy truck and race cars. All the Macy's floats are weatherproof. When folded, they must be no more than 12.5 feet tall and 8 feet wide. That size allows them to fit through the Lincoln Tunnel on their way from the New Jersey studio to New York City. Piper tells me that working on the parade is a dream come true. ""When I was a kid, my two favorite things in the world were cartoons and things that fly,"" he adds. ""The Macy's parade puts both of them together.""

The tsunami destroyed thousands of buildings, including homes, stores, and schools. Since then, temporary schools have been set up in buildings that are still standing and in tents. The girls, along with thousands of other students, can now return to school. ""The opening of these schools is a powerful sign for people that life can begin again,"" said Carol Bellamy, the director of UNICEF. That is a group that helps children in need. UNICEF and other groups have donated thousands of tents and school supplies to countries affected by the tsunami. A tsunami is usually caused by an underwater earthquake or volcanic eruption. The recent tsunami smashed against the coasts of 12 countries in South Asia and East Africa. Tens of thousands of people were killed. Millions of others were left homeless. This map shows the countries in South Asia and East Africa where the tsunami hit. They are shown in yellow. Since the disaster, the world has reached out to help people rebuild their lives. Officials predict that it could take up to 10 years to help the region recover from the tsunami. What are some other ways that schools can rebuild?

121,4,"The kidneys maintain our body's water balance by controlling the water concentration of blood plasma. The kidneys also control salt levels and the excretion of urea. Water that is not put back into the blood is excreted in our urine. from food and drinks. We even get some water when we respire by burning glucose to release energy. in sweat, faeces, urine and when we breathe out (on a cold day you can see this water as it condenses into vapour). For the cells of our body to work properly, it is important that their water content is maintained at the correct level. This means our body must maintain a balance between the water we take in and the water we lose. This is done by the Humans have two kidneys. They are bean-shaped organs, approximately 11.5cm long, that are situated in the abdominal cavity, just below the ribcage, one on either side of the spine. Blood is brought to the kidneys to be filtered, and then returned, to be circulated around the body. As the blood passes through the kidneys, all the small molecules are urea (a waste product from the breakdown of proteins) The kidneys then reabsorb all of the and as much water and salt as the body needs, putting them back into the blood. This leaves some water and salt, and all of the urea, which is now called . The urine passes from the kidneys to the , where it is stored prior to being excreted from the body. The kidneys do more than just control the body’s water balance. They also control: class of chemical compounds, mostly metallic oxides. Examples are sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and magnesium sulphate a nitrogenous waste product resulting from the break down of proteins. It is excreted in urine The kidneys maintain our water balance by producing urine of different concentrations. When the water level of our blood plasma is low, water is reabsorbed back into the blood and the urine becomes more concentrated. When the water level of our blood plasma is high, water is reabsorbed back into the blood and our urine is more dilute. The level of water in the blood plasma can vary depending on: - when it is hot, we sweat more and lose water, thereby making the blood plasma more concentrated. - if we exercise, we get hot and increase our sweating, so we lose more water and the blood plasma becomes more concentrated. - the more we drink, the more we dilute the blood plasma. The kidneys respond by producing more dilute urine to get rid of the excess water. - salt makes the plasma more concentrated. This makes us thirsty, and we drink more water until the excess salt has been excreted by the kidneys. Alcohol causes the kidneys to produce a greater volume of more dilute urine. This can lead to Ecstasy causes the kidneys to produce a smaller volume of less dilute urine. This can result in the body having Read on if you are taking the How the kidneys are controlled - Higher The concentration of our urine is controlled by a that is situated just below the brain.

122,4,"There’s no denying it, the sporting world has never been so illuminated under the media spotlight. Sporting events and sports personalities are bigger, brighter and more branded with big money sponsorship deals than ever before; just look at major events like the Premier League’s Barclays Bank partnership. Then there’s our perception of sport through the eyes of the media; what you read and see isn’t always the truth and can often be affected by international politics. Today, many athletes are role models and celebrities in their own right. Well, who hasn’t heard of David Beckham? To support an event, activity or person by providing money or goods. is a major feature of sport in the 21st century. Most competitions have sponsors names included in their title: Some sports stadia have sponsored names. For example: Most clubs and teams have sponsors. For example: is no longer legal. Sports Governing Bodies have to decide if proposed sponsorship, say junior sport by an alcohol brand, is acceptable. It is always easier to get sponsorship if a sport or event receives media attention. High profile events gain greater amounts of sponsorship than those with no coverage. There are pros and cons of sponsorship: Increased publicity, status increased by being linked to success and glamour. Increased sales of their products Negative events (drug use, cheating, crowd trouble) may affect your reputation Free clothing and equipment or payment for wearing sponsor's clothing and using their equipment. Can concentrate on training without financial worries. May be tied in to a contract including appearances at sponsors' events. Financial support in addition to admission fees etc. Dates, times, clothing may be changed to suit the sponsor. a collective name for images, video and audio coverage of sport is widespread. By listening to commentators, pundits and watching replays we improve our knowledge and understanding. Participation in sports covered by the media is always higher than for those that are not. When watching sport on TV it is important to understand that the director of the programme will have an influence on what is seen and said. You should always analyse what you see and develop your own opinions about events. Media coverage has many pros and cons: Attendances may rise as people want to see the 'stars' Gives viewers a close-up view of the action Attendances may drop - more people watch from home Some sports get lots of exposure, while others get none Events can be sensationalised to promote the media (TV channel, newspaper etc), rather than the sport Changes to playing season (eg rugby league) Changes to the rules (eg badminton, volleyball rally-point rules, tennis tie-breaks) NB Some of these may not been seen as disadvantages by those involved, but they do show the influence of the media. The conduct of players, officials and spectators has an effect on the image of individual sports and the expectations of behaviour by those involved in them. Compare some examples of conduct in sports: Golfers are expected to own up to anything they do wrong - Players are expected to own up to anything that they do wrong and even disqualify themselves. - Diving by players to get a free kick or penalty is increasing and almost everyone is complaining about it. But accepting the rewards when cheating benefits - Opposition fans sit and stand together and there is usually a friendly atmosphere. Police presence and stewarding is light. Video surveillance is almost unheard of. - Although most supporters enjoy the company of the opposition's fans, they are segregated to avoid outbreaks of violence by a minority. Groups of fans taunt each other with insults. Police presence and stewarding is very well organised. Video surveillance is used to identify troublemakers who are banned from future matches. All-seater stadia are required for all Premier League and international matches. - The laws of the game penalise players for arguing with the referee although some acts of violence are dealt with as part of the game. Etiquette requires that the players always clap each other off the field and problems are left on the pitch. - Players often surround the referee to argue with decisions. Acts of violence are often made worse by other players becoming involved and fans continuing to inflame the situation by booing players. Some disagreements on the pitch are continued and fights can break out in the tunnel after the game. Do the fans encourage players to play well or behave badly? Or do the players incite the fans to celebrate or abuse each other? Winners of major tournaments can earn large sums A sportsperson who is not paid for taking part in sport. . However, in demanding success many team owners and sponsors have encouraged players to become A sportsperson who is paid to take part in sport. . Tennis and rugby union are examples of sports that attempted to remain amateur but are now ' open' which means no distinction is made between amateurs and professionals. One of the reasons was the widespread abuse of hidden payments to ‘amateurs’ following the worldwide increase in money for sport from the media. Key differences between amateurs and professionals are: Participation is more important than the result Winning is the most important thing. The more they win, the more they earn Political and financial issues that have affected international sports events Despite the many advantages of hosting a major international event host nations must be prepared for difficulties. The Olympic Games has suffered from a number of different types of problem. These include: Race issue: Black Power - 1968, Mexico City Boycott by some nations - 1984, Los Angeles For the exam you should know a little bit about each of these and you should keep up-to-date with events as they happen. The 2007 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies suffered problems relating to high ticket prices which prevented many locals from attending whilst matches were played in near empty stadiums. In addition the media coverage and police action surrounding the death of Pakistan coach, Bob Woolmer, took attention away from the matches. The 2008 Beijing Olympics have generated lots of media intest and the 2012 London Olympics and future Football and Rugby World Cups will create many discussion points over the next few years. The role of local and national sports providers funded facilities are paid for by national and local government out of taxes and National Lottery funding. They can be found throughout the country. They are available for everyone to use and are relatively cheap. They include sports/leisure centres, swimming pools and outdoor pitches. Some schools share facilities with the local authority for lessons and extra-curricular activities. funded facilities are set up by private companies that try to make a profit. They are often members-only clubs. Members pay fees to join and use the facilities. They are likely to be more expensive. They include sports/fitness clubs, golf and tennis clubs. Some schools pay to use private sports clubs for lessons and extra-curricular activities. Local authorities encourage participation in sport by employing sport development teams including School Sports Coordinators who arrange events, assist with coaching and develop links with clubs in the area of schools.

123,2,"After nearly two decades of rest, a sleeping giant has started to awaken. Mount St. Helens in Washington state is showing signs of life and has left scientists scrambling to determine if it will blow its top. ""Volcanoes are just like people--they're awake and active, and they go to sleep,"" . A volcanologist is a scientist who studies volcanoes. In September, Mount St. Helens began blowing large , or clouds of steam, thousands of feet into the air. The 8,364-foot mountain is not the only restless volcano in the country. Scientists are also paying close attention to awakened volcanoes in Alaska and Hawaii. U.S. Department of Interior, U.S. Geological Survey Steam blasts from a crater on Mount St. Helens in October 2004. Volcanoes can remain quiet for years and then erupt violently, sometimes without warning. Using the latest technology, scientists hope to better Mount St. Helens is located in Washington. Scientists say Mount St. Helens is one of the most closely monitored volcanoes and the most active volcano in the lower 48 states. Mount St. Helens is also among 13 active volcanoes that are located in the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest. That range is home to several powerful volcanoes, such as Mount Rainier and Mount Hood. Although scientists say a large eruption at Mount St. Helens is unlikely, they are cautious because of the volcano's history. Officials have sealed off a 5-mile area around the volcano. Mount St. Helens erupted with tremendous force in May 1980, blowing more than 1,300 feet off its top and killing 57 people. The blast destroyed thousands of acres of forest and scattered ash for thousands of miles. Mount St. Helens continued to rumble until 1986 but has been quiet since that time. How can scientists tell when a volcano will awaken from its slumber? ""We measure earthquake activity, changes in the mountain, and volcanic gases,"" said Driedger. Although scientists can't tell exactly when or with what force a volcano will blow its top, they rely on advanced equipment to help them predict eruptions. Special devices called are installed around volcanoes such as Mount St. Helens to detect earthquakes. Earthquakes always strike before a volcano erupts. Volcanoes are mountains where hot, liquid rock called magma deep inside Earth builds up in chambers. Heat and pressure can cause magma, gases, ash, steam, and other materials to blast out of the crater at the top of the volcano and vents, or cracks, along its side. When magma reaches the surface of the volcano, it is called lava. Once lava cools, it hardens into rock. Scientists use special global positioning instruments to measure movements on the slopes of the mountain--a clue to the buildup of . Magma is red-hot molten rock located inside the volcano. It is called when it pours out of the volcano. As magma rises, volcanoes release carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Sensors on helicopters test the air for gases that signal rising magma. ""The gases are like telegrams that tell us what's going on inside the volcano,"" said Driedger. More than 500 million people around the world live near active volcanoes. Monitoring volcanoes is a dangerous job, but scientists take precautions to stay safe. ""By watching volcanoes, we learn how they work,"" said Driedger. ""The more we know, the better prepared we can be to save property and lives."" Besides volcanoes, what natural disasters are hard for scientists to predict?

127,4,"Most religions offer teaching on war and conflict. And over time religion has been at the heart of conflict between nations. The Sixth Commandment (from the Ten Commandments, given to Moses) says, ‘You shall not murder,’ but there are occasions when the Jewish people are told by God to attack people who oppose them. The famous Old Testament quotation used to justify war: But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot. The words are intended to limit revenge, not encourage vengeance. But revenge is not consistent with the later teaching of Jesus. Jesus is often described as a pacifist. He taught: Blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called the children of God. When he was arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane, his disciples wanted to defend him: When Jesus’ followers saw what was going to happen, they said, ‘Lord, should we strike with our swords?’ And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. But Jesus answered, ‘No more of this!’ And he touched the man’s ear and healed him. There are two occasions in the gospels when Jesus is obviously angry. One of these is in the Temple in Jerusalem: Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money-changers and the benches of those selling doves. ‘It is written,’ he said to them. ‘My house will be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a den of robbers.’ The other event takes place outside of Jerusalem, Early in the morning, as he was on his way back to the city, he was hungry. Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, ‘May you never bear fruit again!’ Immediately the tree withered.’ Most Christians believe that war and fighting are wrong except in the most severe cases and they base their views on Jesus’ teaching about love: A new command I give you: love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. In the past there have been many occasions when Christians have fought wars and when Christian countries have fought each other including: wars in Vietnam, Korea, the Falklands/Malvinos, South Africa, and Northern Ireland Some Christians, such as The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), are totally opposed to fighting and during warfare they are conscientious objectors (taking a public stance against conflict). They are prepared to go into battle driving ambulances or doing other duties but they will not fight. Other Christians are prepared to fight in the armed services and there are always chaplains attached to military units. Most Christians today would probably not condone any war that was not fought according to the ‘Just War’ theory. A war is justified if it is fought for a reason that carries sufficient moral weight. The country that wishes to initiate the use of military force against another nation must demonstrate that there is a 'just' cause to do so. Christians believe that they should protest when injustice is being done against other people, even though they may not be Christians. Then they came for the trade unionists because I was not a trade unionist. "

Other types of spiders chase down their , or poison, from their fangs helps paralyze their food. Although the hairy creatures spook many people, there isn't much reason to be afraid of spiders. ""Most spiders are not very dangerous,"" said Bradley. In fact, most are timid creatures that are unable to give humans more than a harmless bite. Although spider venom is deadly to insects, it often has little effect on humans because of our larger size. Spiders may have a bad reputation for being scary, but they are important to us. Bradley hopes his work shatters some about spiders. (A myth is a false idea that many people believe is true.) Spiders eat mosquitoes and other insects that harm farmers' crops and carry diseases. Bradley's research is teaching scientists more about how spiders help control , or communities of plants and animals. If spiders didn't exist, there would be a lot more insects! ""Spiders are your friends,"" Bradley said. ""They make our life more pleasant."" Get caught up on some different types of spiders. Spiders come in all shapes and sizes. Crab spiders, jumping spiders, and orb weavers have made Rich Bradley's Ohio count. Find out more about them and other spiders. Can you guess how this spider got its name? It may not live in the ocean, but it looks like a crab. The crab spider lives on flowers. It can match its body color to the flower's color. That allows it to sneak up on insects. What a leap! The jumping spider can jump between 10 and 40 inches. To catch an insect, this hunting spider sneaks up on its prey and pounces. The trap-door spider lives in a tunnel. The spider, common in the southwestern United States, lines the tunnel with silk and fashions a door made of silk and dirt. It peeks out of the slightly open door and grabs passing insects. The tarantula is a large, hairy spider found mainly in warm regions, including the southwestern United States. Although the tarantula's bite is painful, it is not very poisonous to humans. Tarantulas hunt insects, lizards, mice, toads, and frogs. E. B. White's famous spider Charlotte was an orb weaver. The orb-weaving spider spins a wheel-shaped web. When an insect flies into the web, the spider races toward its meal. What other animals frighten people but are good for the environment?

130,2,"This map shows where Mount Vesuvius is located. (veh-SOO-vee-uhss) majestically stands over the Italian landscape. The scenic mountain rises 4,200 feet high southeast of the city of Naples, which is located in southern Italy. But many people living in this region fear Mount Vesuvius. That's because it is an active volcano. Nearly 2,000 years ago, Vesuvius exploded with tremendous force. Deadly smoke, gases, and rock shot more than 9 miles high in the air. That is about one and a half times the height of Mount Everest, the world's tallest mountain. A thick black cloud engulfed the region and blocked out the sun. An avalanche of boiling poured from the volcano at speeds of up to 70 miles per hour. Lava is melted rock from a volcano. The explosion sealed the ancient city of Pompeii (pahm-PAY) under a blanket of rock and ash. A mudslide wiped out the nearby town of Herculaneum (her-kyuh-LAY-nee-uhm). Many people died as a result of the volcano's fury. Although many eruptions have occurred since then, Vesuvius hasn't exploded with such force since that devastating day. The last major eruption occurred in 1944. Scientists warn, though, that it's only a matter of time before Mount Vesuvius erupts with tremendous force again. ""It won't be tomorrow, it won't be next month, and maybe it won't be next year,"" a scientist who monitors the volcano told . ""But [Vesuvius] is overdue [to explode]."" Today, nearly 600,000 people live in the 18 towns surrounding Vesuvius. This high-risk area is known as the ""red zone."" Officials estimate that they would need two weeks to evacuate all the people living in the red zone. According to scientists, anything within 4 miles of Vesuvius could be destroyed during the first 15 minutes of an eruption. The volcano's past, however, hasn't stopped people from moving into the area. In fact, Italian officials are concerned about the overcrowding of people in the red zone. To encourage people to move away from this area, they have put a plan in place. Some families are being offered $36,000 to move to safer locations. The goal is to persuade about 150,000 families to move from the area near the volcano within the next 15 years. In 1995, the government also created a national park near the top of Vesuvius. That limits the number of people living there. ""Vesuvius is the most dangerous volcano in the world on account of the number of people living under it,"" said the president of the Naples region. ""The smaller the population, the smaller the danger Vesuvius represents."" A volcano is a mountain with an opening on the top called a A volcano erupts when hot, melted rock called magma collects in chambers beneath Earth's surface. Pressure builds up in the chambers and causes , gases, ash, and other materials to blast out of the top of the volcano and , or cracks, along its sides. Once outside the volcano, the magma is called lava. measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc. All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation. "

Those add up to one big problem: Kids are not getting enough exercise. Parents, teachers, and health experts are concerned. According to a new report issued by the American Heart Association, 8.8 million kids and teens weigh too much. The report shows that 15 percent of 6- to 11-year-olds are overweight. This is more than double from 20 years ago. ""Although children may not realize it now, they are setting themselves up for a lifetime of health problems,"" said one doctor. Experts say that overweight kids are at risk for developing heart problems and diabetes as adults. To help kids develop good health habits, some schools are adding gym classes back into the curriculum. Others are , or changing, gym routines so they extend beyond traditional team sports. One school district in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, has added climbing walls to 13 of its 17 elementary schools. Others are offering dance, aerobics, and kite flying to help kids get fit. The goal of physical education is to keep kids active for life-inside school and out. Many schools are stressing the importance of fitness at a young age. One gym teacher said that physical education classes combine fitness with fun to encourage children to lead healthful, active lifestyles. Daily exercise offers enormous benefits to children.

137,4,"Nanochemistry works with materials at the atomic level and has many potential applications for medical science. The element carbon comes in different forms or 'allotropes' - three examples are diamond, graphite and Buckminster Fullerene. Their properties make them useful for different purposes. Three forms (or 'allotropes') of pure carbon are diamond, graphite and buckminster fullerene (or 'buckyballs'). In all three allotropes the carbon atoms are joined by but in such different arrangements that the properties of the allotropes are very different. Diamonds are colourless and clear (transparent). They sparkle and reflect light – they're lustrous. These properties make them desirable in items of . For this reason it's very useful in . The cutting edges of discs used to cut bricks and concrete are tipped with diamonds. Heavy-duty drill bits, like those used in the oil exploration industry to drill through rocks, are made with diamonds so that they stay sharp for longer. Diamond is insoluble in water. It does not conduct electricity. Every atom in a diamond is bonded to its neighbours by leaving no free electrons and no ions. That's why diamond does not conduct electricity. The bonding also explains the . A lot of energy would be needed to separate atoms so strongly bonded together. Graphite is formed from carbon atoms in Graphite is black, shiny and opaque (not transparent). It's also a very slippery material. It's used in – it slips easily off the pencil onto the paper and leaves a black mark. It's a component of many , for example bicycle chain oil. Graphite is insoluble in water. It has a high melting point and is a good conductor of electricity, which makes it a suitable material for the Each carbon atom is bonded into its layer with three strong covalent bonds. This leaves each atom with a , which together form a delocalised ‘sea’ of electrons loosely bonding the layers together. These delocalised electrons can all move along together – making graphite a good electrical conductor. Because the layers are only weakly held together they can easily slip over one another: hence the slipperiness of graphite. Melting graphite is not easy however. It takes a lot of energy to break the strong covalent bonds and separate the carbon atoms. Structure of a buckminsterfullerene molecule - a large ball of 60 atoms Buckminster Fullerene is one type of fullerene. Fullerenes are made from carbon atoms joined together to make balls, ‘cages’ or tubes of carbon. The molecules of Buckminster Fullerene are spherical and are also known as 'buckyballs' – formula C Buckminster Fullerene is a black solid although it's deep red when in solution in petrol. which are very strong and are conductors of electricity. Their unusual electrical properties mean that nanotubes are used as in electronic circuits. Their strength makes them useful in reinforcing structures where exceptional lightness and strength are needed for example, the frame of a tennis racket.

138,4,"The Earth has a layered structure made up of the core, mantle and crust. The lithosphere - the crust and upper part of the mantle - is broken into large pieces called tectonic plates. These move slowly over the mantle. Volcanoes occur when molten rock pushes up through weaknesses in the crust. The molten rock cools and solidifies to form igneous rocks, such as basalt, gabbro, rhyolite and granite. Cross section showing structure of the Earth The Earth is almost a sphere. These are its main layers, starting with the outermost: - has the properties of a solid, but can flow very slowly - made from liquid nickel and iron - made from solid nickel and iron consists of the crust and outer part of the mantle. It is the relatively cold outer part of the Earth’s structure. The Earth’s lithosphere is broken into large pieces called continental plates form the continents - land Tectonic plates are less dense than the mantle, so they are found on top of it. The plates are moving constantly, at a rate of a few centimetres each year. Where tectonic plates meet, the Earth’s crust becomes unstable as the plates push against each other, or ride under or over one another. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions happen at the boundaries between plates. Magma - molten rock - is less dense than the crust. It can rise to the surface through weaknesses in the crust, forming a volcano. Geologists study volcanoes to try to predict future eruptions. Volcanoes can be very destructive, but some people choose to live near them because volcanic soil is very fertile. It contains minerals needed by plants for healthy growth. Lava is the molten rock that erupts from a volcano. Some eruptions produce runny lava, while others produce thick lava that escapes violently. Igneous rocks are made when molten rock cools down and solidifies. Igneous rocks contain interlocking crystals. The size of the crystals depends on how quickly the molten rock cooled: if it cooled quickly, the crystals are small if it cooled slowly, the crystals are large The slower the molten rock cools, the larger the crystals in the igneous rock. A summary of the properties of four igneous rocks and how they were formed Basalt is rich in iron, and rhyolite is rich in silica. The mantle is the zone between the Earth’s crust and its core. It is relatively cold and rigid just below the crust. At greater depths, the mantle is able to flow because it is hot and non-rigid. The theory of plate tectonics was proposed at the beginning of the last century by a German scientist named Alfred Wegener. It took more than 50 years for Wegener’s theory to be accepted. This was because it was difficult to work out the mechanism that could make whole continents move. It was not until the 1960s that enough evidence was discovered to fully support the theory. Tectonic plates move because of convection currents in the Earth’s mantle. These are driven by the heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements inside the Earth. Oceanic plates are denser than continental plates. Where they meet, the oceanic plate goes under the continental plate. This is called . The oceanic plate is partially re-melted.

144,4,"Making decisions on moral issues is not easy. Religion helps followers to make decisions that are pleasing to God and create a society where people respect and care for each other People draw on a variety of sources of authority to help them make a decision. For example: religious leaders and the official teaching of their religion There are two types of morality that affect the decisions people make – absolute morality and relative morality. If you believe in absolute morality you will have faith that there is a right course of action to take in a moral dilemma, which is true in all situations regardless of culture, religious tradition, time or age. How would a follower of this sort of morality respond to the commandment ‘Do not kill’? They would try to make sure that they were not involved in any killing, which would affect their views on issues such as war, abortion and euthanasia. They would say that these actions are wrong in all circumstances. If you believe in relative morality you would agree that different courses of action might be needed in different situations. How would a follower of this sort of morality respond to the commandment ‘Do not kill’? They would agree that killing is wrong, but would look at a range of other issues as well and say that sometimes killing might be necessary in a particular situation, such as abortion, if continuing the pregnancy would result in the birth of a very disabled child, or if the mother had been raped. Contraception or ‘birth control’ is used for a variety of reasons: when pregnancy might harm the mental or physical condition of the mother to limit the number of children people have to ensure they don't damage living standards or affect other children to prevent pregnancy in people who do not want a child at this stage in their lives The various Christian churches have different views on contraception: says that the use of contraception is against natural law (which means it is not in keeping with human nature). It is natural that conception may happen with intercourse and therefore this should not be prevented. The only form of contraception permitted is the ‘rhythm method’ where intercourse takes place at a time when the woman is least fertile. churches (eg, the Anglican Church and the Methodist Church) now see the use of contraception within marriage as a responsible way of planning a family. It allows sex to be enjoyed without the fear of an unwanted pregnancy. Abortion is the artificial ending of the life of a foetus in the womb (uterus). A natural abortion is called a miscarriage. Abortion has been legal in England, Scotland and Wales since 1967 when The Abortion Act was passed. A new upper time limit of 24 weeks was introduced in 1990 under The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act. An abortion may be carried out if one of the following conditions applies: the life or physical health of the mother is at risk the mental health of the mother is at risk there is a reasonable chance that the child will be born seriously disabled Where the mental health of the mother is at risk, or her family will suffer if the pregnancy continues, the latest termination date is 24 weeks. There is no upper limit if the life or physical health of the mother is at risk, or if there is a reasonable chance of a seriously disabled child being born. In 1974 119,000 legal abortions were carried out in England and Wales, by 2006 this figure had risen to 193,700. The Christian Church teaches that life is a sacred gift from God: Then God said, ‘Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.’ So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. Christian teaching on abortion is complex. An early Christian document, the Didache, condemns it: You shall not kill by abortion the fruit of the womb. The Bible appears to say that life begins when the baby is in the mother’s womb: For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb. Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart. opposes abortion in every instance. However, if life saving treatment given to a pregnant woman results in the unavoidable loss of a foetus, but saves the mother, then this is accepted and known as 'double effect'. Roman Catholic teaching is that the foetus is a human being. This is clearly expressed in the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) which states: From the first moment of his(her) existence, a human being must be recognised as having the rights of a person – among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. (Quakers) believe that although abortion should not be encouraged, the life of the unborn child cannot be seen as more important than that of the mother. movement generally argues that life becomes human life at the point of conception. It says that abortion should not be allowed, but most would allow an abortion if the mother’s life was at risk or if pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. movement generally argues that human life begins much later in pregnancy, or at birth. There are many points of view among pro-choicers, but fundamentally they think that the woman should have full control over what happens to her body.

145,4,"This section will help you revise the way that musical production has changed over the centuries - from the development of the orchestra, to the impact of music technology on the pop song. Below is a checklist of key points you should know about the main periods in western music history. and describes the enormous cultural awakening that blossomed within the arts, sciences and letters throughout Europe at this time. New instruments were invented such as the viola and the violin. Some important composers of the time were: Giovani da Palestrina, Andrea Gabrielli, Josquin Desperez and Johannes Ockeghem This period is named after the ornate architecture that was popular at that time. Composers experimented with the ability of music to express human emotion and depict natural phenomenon. Vivaldi's The string and woodwind sections of the orchestra were established, and a keyboard continuo part (usually played on a harpsichord) was added. The oboe was introduced and the viol was completely replaced by the violin. A new musical genre was created called Opera: composers were seeking to re-create the drama of the ancient Greeks by fusing poetry, theatre, visual arts and music. The first big opera, by Claudio Monteverdi, was performed in 1607. Some important composers of the period were: Claudio Monteverdi, Johann Sebastian Bach, Antonio Vivaldi and George Friedrich Handel. The Classical era was so named because artists, musicians and writers looked towards the clean, uncluttered elegance of the art and philosophy of classical Greece. Harmony was simpler than in the Baroque era. Alberti bass parts were sometimes used (simple broken chords). Melodies were simple and uncomplicated. Some important composers of the time were: Franz Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig Van Beethoven and Christoph Von Gluck. The Romantics were probably the first artists in history to apply a generic name to themselves. The name harks back to the mediaeval romance: poems of chivalry, unattainable love, and distant, enchanted places. The percussion section was expanded to include cymbals and side drum The brass family developed at this time. Trumpets and horns now had valves and keys, so they could produce more notes, and trombones, previously only used in church music and operas, were added to the orchestra. Nationalism was a major cultural force, and many composers (especially in Russia and eastern Europe) sought to create a national music by importing folk music, dance, poetry and prose into their works. Some important composers of the time were: Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Giuesseppe Verdi and Richard Wagner. Advances in music technology became increasingly important, with new methods of recording, electronic instruments, and the use of computers having a major influence on modern music. New genres emerged alongside the classical forms of 20th-Century art music: blues, jazz, rock 'n roll, and electronic music. Some important composers of the period were: Claude Debussy, Igor Stravinsky, Dmitri Shostakovich, Gustav Mahler, John Cage and Phillip Glass. The percussion section was expanded even further to include xylophone, marimba, and various other percussion. Flutes, harps and organs were in use throughout the middle ages, reaching more-or-less their modern form by the 12th Century. The harpsichord had arrived by the 14th Century, though it became most popular in the Baroque period. Violas and violins arrived in the 16th century. Modern oboes andclarinets had evolved by the 18th Century. The modern piano was also developed at this time. Approximate dates key instruments arrived in the orchestra and examples of composers active at that time The use of electronic instruments and the means of amplification had an enormous effect on the development of 20th century music including jazz, blues, rock and roll, world music (including bhangra and salsa), disco and modern dance music, as well as some art music including serialism and minimalism. In minimalism electronically recorded and in some cases, manipulated, sounds may be heard. The ability to record and transmit music saw quicker and wider dissemination of music in the 20th century. Modern recording techniques include the use of multitrack recording facilities and the use of computer software programmes. Some of the most important techniques in music production The process of changing a sound by reducing the level of louder sounds and increasing the level of quieter sounds. This is usually applied to vocals. The sound produced when too much signal is sent to parts of an electronic system such as an amplifier or loudspeakers, resulting in a change to the original sound. Some electric guitarists use it deliberately to produce a particular sound. Distortion is usually used in Heavy Metal music. Sound processing where the original sound is changed by adding one or more clearly discernible repeats of the original sound (the repeats usually die away). A sound processing unit capable of adding a range of different effects to the sound such as echo, phasing and flanging. A control on a mixer, which moves the sound between two outputs, such as left and right (similar to a balance control on a hi-fi system). Sound processing where the original sound is changed by adding hundreds of short reflections (this makes it sound as though the sound is being played in a large space, such as a church). A sound is recorded and then edited in a computer. The end sound is sometimes used in dance music. A device which enables musicians to record musical data which can then be played back, edited and stored.

147,0,"Tornado season has started in the United States. A is a powerful, spinning wind. It is also known as a twister. Most tornadoes last fewer than 15 minutes. During that time, a twister can travel across a large area of land and destroy everything in its path. The strong winds in some tornadoes reach speeds of up to 300 miles per hour. Those winds can toss cars and other objects high into the air. Tornadoes can happen any time of the year. However, they are most common from March through July. A tornado can destroy homes and trees. Most tornadoes start as thunderstorms. During those storms, heavy rain and lightning are common. Large , or ball-shaped pieces of ice, may also fall. Large thunderstorm clouds appear in the sky. The clouds become dark. Thunder can be heard. Warm and cold air meet. Air rises from the ground to the clouds. If the rising air starts to spin, a funnel-shaped cloud can form. The funnel-shaped cloud spins faster. When the bottom of the cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado. As the tornado travels across the ground, it picks up anything in its way.

148,2,"Wildfires will be California's most expensive natural disaster. The wildfires that recently swept through southern California have been called one of the Golden State's worst natural disasters. The raging wildfires destroyed homes, businesses, and forests. Nearly 750,000 acres burned-an area of land about the size of Rhode Island. ""The whole sky seemed as if it was on fire,"" said one California resident. Investigators say both people and nature were to blame for the fires. The fires spread rapidly because of the Santa Ana winds, which blow hot, dry air from the desert. Cold and rainy weather eventually rolled in to help quench the flames. About 15,000 firefighters battled flames that were out of control. Thousands of people had to quickly , or leave, their homes to escape the fire's destructive path. Many families lost their homes and belongings in the fires. At least 22 people died as a result of the fires. President Bush declared several southern California counties disaster areas. Governor-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger will work with officials to help homeowners and businesses rebuild. Government officials say the wildfires will be California's most expensive natural disaster. They estimate rebuilding efforts will cost more than $2 billion. All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation. "

The properties of compounds are usually very different from the properties of the elements they contain. For example hydrogen and oxygen are both gases at room temperature, but water is a liquid. The reaction between iron and sulfur to make is often used in school to study elements and compounds. Look at the animation to remind you what happens in this reaction. A test tube is filled with a mixture of iron and sulfur. The table compares the properties of iron and sulfur (the two elements), and iron sulfide (the compound).

153,3,"The extract comes from a book called 'Face' by Benjamin Zephaniah. Natalie is a Year 9 student and lives in East London. She is out with her boyfriend and his friends. They have stopped to chat with some boys from school. Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. You can use the bullet points to help you. After a couple of minutes she realised that her every move was being watched by a group of three girls and she couldn't help noticing how tough they looked. All three were wearing dark blue baggy jeans. She was pretty sure they were Londoners born and bred but thought they could find a job working for the Jamaican tourist board, not simply because of their dark skin but also because of their clothing. One had a T-shirt saying 'I love Jamaica'. Another wore a T-shirt that was a Jamaican flag and the third just had a West Ham football shirt on, but she, like the others, was adorned with yellow, black and green bangles, badges and necklaces. Natalie thought they looked good, but dangerous. Natalie shifted nervously. She didn't know quite where to look but she had to put on a front. The other three girls made no attempt to hide the fact that they were on Natalie's case. They began to whisper to each other and smile as they stared at her. Natalie felt illuminated in her green satins and began to wish she had chosen clothes which weren't so loud. What are they grinning at? she wondered. Is it my clothes? My shoes? My hair? Do I look too innocent? Suddenly the three girls began to walk toward Natalie. Her heart began to race, the palms of her hands began to sweat. She felt like falling apart but she held herself together. 'You from round here, den?' said the big girl wearing the Jamaican flag. 'Yeah, I wanid to go there but they wouldn't let me, said I had ta go ta Lonsdale Park, said it was nearer. What ya doing here?' The other two girls continued to look her up and down. Natalie expected trouble and in her mind she cursed the boys for bringing her there and for the way they had got lost in their silly conversation about football and cars. 'I'm just hanging around with my boyfriend and his mates.' At this point the girl wearing the West Ham shirt reached into her back pocket. Natalie swallowed hard as the girl pulled out a couple of leaflets. After separating one from the other she handed one to Natalie. 'Dat's the place to be, check it out, good vibes, good music. Ya like rap?' Natalie wanted to kick herself. She had completely misread the situation. They weren't out for a fight, they wanted to find out if she liked clubbing. They wanted to find out if she was one of them, an Eastender. 'Yeah,' Natalie replied, feeling a sense of relief. 'Yeah, rap's cool...' She began to wonder if she sometimes looked threatening and if she herself had been misjudged in the past. For people to be friendly, did they have to have permanent smiles on their faces? How does the writer show Natalie's thoughts and feelings changing during the extract? her first reactions to the girls she sees the way she acts just before, and when, they speak to her her thoughts at the end of the passage. Just before the girls speak to her, Natalie seems even more anxious. She is used to being out on the streets of London and feels she needs to 'put on a front' and look tough. She is afraid they may be laughing at her clothes or hair, which makes her seem insecure about herself. However, when the girls come up to speak to her she hides her nerves and answers their questions. The way she uses short answers like 'Yeah' suggests she does not want to give too much away about herself or get into a fight. When she realises the girls are actually being friendly and want to give her a flyer for a club, Natalie's feelings change completely. She is ashamed of being suspicious and feels like 'kicking herself'. She realises the girls are Eastenders just like her. The writer shows how this makes her think about her own image. She wonders if people think she looks threatening, too. At this point she comes across as an intelligent, thoughtful girl who wants to learn how to judge people fairly in the future.

Inspired by the popular yellow wristbands introduced by champion cyclist Lance Armstrong to raise money for cancer research, Sydney had her own idea. ""I thought, 'Why can't we have one for diabetes?' "" she told since she was in kindergarten. She is one of 18 million people in the United States with this disease. In a person with diabetes, the body makes little or no . That is a substance that the body needs to help convert , a sugar in food, into energy. With the help of her friend Daniel Rosen, 13, who also has diabetes, Sydney ordered blue wristbands with the slogan ""Cure Diabetes Today."" The two friends started selling the wristbands in their New Jersey community to raise money for research aimed at curing diabetes. After only a month, they had sold 10,000 bracelets and donated the contributions to the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center in New York City. The bracelets were in such high demand that the diabetes center began selling them on its Web site. ""We made over $100,000 already!"" said Sydney.

Optical fibres can carry more information than an ordinary cable of the same diameter. Signals can be either analogue or digital. Digital signals maintain their quality over longer distances than analogue signals. Signals are sent from a transmitter to a receiver. This can be done in many ways: using Electromagnetic radiation with a frequency between that of visible light and radio waves. Low frequency electromagnetic radiation used to transmit information such as television and radio programmes. through the Earth’s atmosphere and through space, or through cables using A fine glass fibre, through which light travels by total internal reflection, from one end to the other. All signals, as they travel, decrease in The maximum height of a wave, measured from the mid-point of its vibration. . This means that if they are transmitted over long distances they must be amplified (made bigger) along the way. Before a sound or piece of information is transmitted, it is encoded in the transmitter in one of the ways described below - analogue or digital. The receiver must then decode the signal to produce a copy of the original information or sound. continuous data, eg the second hand on an analogue watch displays each second and the space in-between signals vary continuously in amplitude, frequency or both. data measured at discrete intervals, eg a digital watch typically moves from displaying one second to the next without displaying the values in-between signals are a series of pulses with two states - on or off.

Which of these words are not English? A1. They are all written in English! A2. All of them are familiar English words, but originally they were borrowed from Indian languages. English is a language that is constantly changing and evolving. If it didn't, we'd still be speaking like Shakespeare! - each generation provides words known as 'slang' - often many of these words become accepted into mainstream English eg 'ok' and 'cool'. However, many slang terms lose popularity as a new generation emerges with their own slang words and phrases - making words such as 'phat' and 'groovy' history. - the multi-cultural society we live in often provides new or adapted words. You might be familiar with the term 'avatar' in online communities but did you know the word is actually Hindi in origin? Has anyone ever said 'gesundheit' after you've sneezed? This is actually a German word, which has become popular in English. - these are words or phrases that you only hear in a particular geographical area eg do you eat your sausage in a roll, bap or bun? Depending on where you live, it could be any of these. If you're Cornish, you might hear someone from Birmingham or Scotland using different words and grammar to you, even though you're all still speaking English.

159,4,"Atoms are joined together by chemical bonds, which involve the electrons found around the nucleus of the atom. Covalent bonds and ionic bonds are two types of chemical bond. During a chemical reaction, reactants are changed into products. Chemical symbols and formulae are used to represent substances in symbol equations. Molecular formulae show the number of each type of atom in a molecule, while displayed formulae show the atoms and bonds in a molecule. An atom is the smallest part of an element that still has the properties of that element, comprising electrons surrounding a nucleus of protons and neutrons. The central part of an atom. It contains protons and neutrons, and has most of the mass of the atom. Sub-atomic particles, with a negative charge and a negligible mass relative to protons and neutrons. The nucleus is positively charged, and the electrons are negatively charged. A substance made of one type of atom only. is made of atoms of just one particular sort. The atoms of any element are different to the atoms of any other element. So iron is made from a different sort of atom to sulfur, and carbon atoms are different to oxygen atoms. The atoms of each element are represented by chemical symbols. These usually consist of one or two different letters. Three letters are sometimes used for newly discovered elements. The first letter in a chemical symbol is always an UPPER CASE letter. The other letters are always lower case. So the symbol for magnesium is Mg, and not mg, MG or mG. Every element has its own chemical symbol. For example, iron is Fe, sulfur is S, sodium is Na, and oxygen is O. Find out why you should probably wash that pile of dirty socks - try this activity!

Pasteur's discovery that Knowledge about the body increased greatly in the 19th century: (America: 1822) studied the digestive system of Alexis St Martin, a Canadian who had an open hole into his stomach. (Germany: 1839) realised that animal matter was made up of cells, not 'humours'. This was the vital breakthrough of knowledge that at last destroyed belief in the old 'humoral' pathology of the Greeks. (Scotland: 1858) wrote 'Gray's Anatomy', which had over 1,000 illustrations. Many people bought a copy to own at home. After the 1870s, pupils started studying anatomy in schools. (Poland: 1912) discovered the first vitamins, and realised that some diseases were caused simply by poor diet. Louis Pasteur, French microbiologist and the 'father' of the germ theory of disease. Image first published in 1894. Knowledge about disease also increased greatly in the 19th century. (France: 1860s) discovered (by using a swan-necked flask) that . Before he made this discovery, doctors had noticed bacteria, but they believed it was the disease that caused the bacteria (the so-called theory of 'spontaneous generation') rather than the other way round. One of the spin-offs of Pasteur's discovery was the A process in which a liquid is heated to a specific temperature, in order to kill microorganisms in the liquid that could be damaging to health. of milk, which prevented it from going sour by killing the germs and sealing it from the air. Other scientists also made crucial discoveries, among them: (Germany: 1878), who discovered how to stain and in a Petri dish (named after his assistant Julius Petri). He was thus able to find which bacteria caused which diseases: In the same period other bacteria were discovered, including those that caused: (Britain: 1876) discovered that elephantiasis was caused by a nematode worm, and that mosquitoes were the vector (carrier). This was a , because researchers soon found out that other tropical diseases were transmitted by vectors such as mosquitoes (malaria and yellow fever) or tsetse flies (sleeping sickness). (France: 1884) found that there are organisms even smaller than bacteria that also cause disease - he had discovered Causes of improvements in physiology and pathology There was a general atmosphere of scientific research and advance. Louis Pasteur's first commission was to find a , which set him off on his revolutionary course. Joseph Jackson Lister (Britain: 1826) invented the , which allowed doctors to see very tiny things accurately. Carl Ludwig (Germany: 1847) invented the kymograph, which allowed more accurate measurement of the Jan Purkinje (Czechoslovakia: 1836) set up the first university department of physiology (science of how the body works). Louis Pasteur started as a research chemist. He set up a team of researchers at the Pasteur Institute (1888). of how researchers should find a disease. These led to four basic procedures the germ in question is present in the sick specimen Nationalism - eg the rivalry of Pasteur and Koch.

166,0,"When kids get flu shots, everyone may end up healthier. That is what a new study shows. Almost 50 farming in Canada took part in the study. A community is a group of people living in an area. Kids in half the communities were given flu shots. Kids in the other half were not given flu shots. No adults were given flu shots. What did scientists learn? Fewer adults and kids in the flu shot group got the flu. The scientists say that giving flu shots to kids can protect the whole community. Health experts say kids should get a flu vaccine every year.

167,4,"You will need to take care when drawing conclusions from data about air pollution. A number of different influences can affect the data and these need to be taken into consideration. Not all data, and the conclusions that are drawn from it, has the same validity. A scientist may take a set of measurements, or make some observations, and draw conclusions from them. If the scientist can , and get similar data, this provides more evidence to support those conclusions. The conclusions are therefore more likely to be valid. Scientists report their work in scientific journals and at conferences. Before publication, the work is checked and evaluated by other experts. This process is known as 'peer review'. When scientists report their work, other scientists can see what they have done and try to repeat it. If these other scientists obtain similar data, it provides more evidence to support the conclusions that have been published. Scientific findings are only accepted once they have been evaluated critically by other scientists. Scientists are interested in what happens, and what may change how these things happen. Something that happens is called an 'outcome'. Things that may change the way this happens are called 'factors'. The quality of the air on a street is an example of an outcome. Factors that may affect this outcome include the number and type of vehicles using the street, whether there are factories along the street, the strength and direction of the wind, and so on. If a factor is changed this may lead to a change in the outcome. Some factors may increase the chances of an outcome but not inevitably lead to it. For example, smoking cigarettes increases the chances of a person getting lung cancer, but some people who smoke never get lung cancer. A correlation is a link between two things. If an outcome happens when a factor is present, and does not happen when the factor is absent, there is a . Or, if an outcome increases or decreases when a factor increases or decreases, there is a correlation. We say there is a correlation between the factor and the outcome. Graph showing number of cigarettes smoked against the number of deaths from cancer For example, studies show that there is a correlation between how much a person smokes and how likely they are to get lung cancer. As the number of cigarettes smoked increases, the percentage of people who smoke that number and get lung cancer also increases. But a person may smoke cigarettes and never get lung cancer. One individual case does not provide evidence for or against a correlation. A correlation is only valid when there is a Read on if you are taking the The fact that there is a correlation between a factor and an outcome does not necessarily mean this factor causes the outcome. There is a correlation between the pollen count in the air and the incidence of hay fever, for instance. The pollen count increases from spring onwards, reaching a peak in mid-summer. It is therefore possible that pollen causes hay fever. There is also a correlation between the amount of ice cream sold during the summer and the number of hay fever cases. But nobody would suggest that eating ice cream causes hay fever. between a factor and an outcome there has to be a mechanism that explains how the factor causes the outcome. In the case of hay fever, skin tests show that people who get hay fever are allergic to pollen. This is supporting evidence that hay fever can be caused by an allergic reaction to pollen. "
168,2,"The Liberty Bell no longer rings today. During the move, wireless technology will be attached to the bell. The Liberty Bell is about to get a new home. This fall, it will move from its current location at Liberty Bell Pavilion in Philadelphia to a new building down the street. Why the change of address? It is part of improvements being made to the area where the bell now hangs. Moving the bell, which weighs 2,080 pounds, could be tricky. Movers want to make sure that no additional harm is done to the bell's famous crack. During the move, scientists will attach wireless technology to the bell. That technology will sound an alarm if strain from the move causes the crack to enlarge. Earlier this year, scientists conducted a test using wireless technology, and the crack did not appear to change. ""The bell is fragile because of the way it was [made],"" said one historian. The bell was built mostly of copper. In 1752, the bell was brought to Philadelphia from England. The bell was rung to mark special events. It became a symbol of freedom in the United States. It was rung to call people to the first public reading of the Declaration of Independence on July 8, 1776. That document was signed on July 4, 1776. This is not the first time the Liberty Bell has moved. From 1885 to 1915, the Liberty Bell traveled across the country, taking part in several World's Fair exhibits. During those years, it visited more than 400 cities and towns, including New Orleans, St. Louis, and San Francisco. The last time the Liberty Bell changed location was in 1976. At that time, it was taken from Independence Hall to its current nearby home. Many people consider Independence Hall the birthplace of the United States. Both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution were signed there. The Liberty Bell cracked the first time it was rung in 1752. However, the bell was rebuilt twice in its early years. The Liberty Bell cracked again sometime between 1817 and 1846. How it cracked remains a mystery. According to one report, its famous split occurred in February 1846 while it was ringing to celebrate George Washington's birthday. All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.

169,2,"Hawaii is famous for its fiery volcanoes and rivers of lava. According to legend, those volcanoes were created by the goddess Pele, who made the fiery mountains by driving her digging stick into the ground. Such legends are important to native Hawaiians. Today, however, ancient gods are a part of a fiery debate in this land of spirits. Mauna Kea is an extinct, or dead, volcano on the island of Hawaii. According to an ancient Hawaiian saying, Mauna Kea ""is the astonishing mountain that stands in the calm."" These days the 13,700-foot-high peak is anything but calm. , scientists who study space, say the mountain peak is a perfect spot to place telescopes. Currently, scientists use 13 telescopes in a special 11,000-acre area called the Science Reserve on Mauna Kea. Using those telescopes, scientists have made several important astronomical discoveries. The scientists who use the telescopes pay a fee to the University of Hawaii, which built the observatories. The use of the mountain for scientific research, however, is the source of a debate between scientists and some native Hawaiians. Some Hawaiians believe that the top of Mauna Kea is sacred, or an important place to their religion. They believe that the peak is the home of the snow goddess Poli'ahu. According to officials at the Center for Hawaiian Studies, the university is making money from the site without sharing much of the money with native Hawaiians. ""We don't get a penny from Mauna Kea, and it's our land,"" said Jon Osorio, of the Center for Hawaiian Studies. University officials say that a master plan, completed in June, addresses native Hawaiian concerns. The goals of the plan include educating people about Mauna Kea. It also states how many telescopes the university can build in the future. According to observers, the debate will not end soon. A 1968 agreement gives the university control of the area until 2033. Until then, native Hawaiians will fight for what is theirs while scientists keep studying the skies. , which is a type of government led by a king or queen. In 1778, Hawaii had its first contact with Europeans when English Captain James Cook landed on the islands. He named them the Sandwich Islands. Cook was later killed by Hawaiian warriors when he returned to the islands. Over the next 100 years, more foreigners, including Americans, arrived on the islands. A struggle for power ended in 1893 when American plantation owners helped overthrow Queen Liliuokalani. By 1900, Hawaii had officially become a U.S. territory.

170,2,"Small steps can help solve the world’s water crisis. Kids really can make a difference. Just ask 15-year-old Ryan Hreljac (HURL-jak) of Kemptville, Canada. When he was 6, he learned about the shortage of safe drinking water in some parts of the world. Today, Ryan’s Well Foundation has raised more than $1.5 million to build more than 200 wells in 11 countries, most in Africa. During his mission to raise money, Ryan became pen pals with Akana Jimmy, an orphan who lived in Africa. In Jimmy’s tiny village of Agweo, Uganda, there was no clean water until Ryan raised enough money to buy the village its first well. A new book tells the story of their life-changing friendship— Ryan and Jimmy and the Well in Africa That Brought Them Together. Jimmy used to wake up before midnight and walk 3 miles to the nearest pond. There, he would fill a large plastic container with or polluted, water. Jimmy made that trip three times every day before heading to school. ""Because you don’t have any choice, you drink it,"" he told In 1998, Ryan’s first-grade teacher told the class that polluted water was causing thousands of children to become sick and even die. For Ryan, a lack of clean water was unimaginable. His teacher said the cost of building a well in Africa was just $70. Determined to help, Ryan spent months doing household chores to earn enough money to pay for a well. Later that year, Ryan proudly took his savings to WaterCan, a Canadian organization that helps provide safe drinking water to impoverished countries. To his disappointment, Ryan was told that the cost of building a well was much higher: $2,000. or promised, to continue raising money. Word of his mission spread, and soon the media picked up his story. To Ryan’s astonishment, people started sending him donations. By 2000, Ryan, then 9, had raised enough money to build his first well. With help from Canadian Physicians for Aid and Relief, Ryan chose Jimmy’s village as the site for the well. Ryan’s well changed the lives of the people in Agweo and especially affected Jimmy’s life. That’s when the two boys became pen pals. They became friends when Ryan traveled to Uganda in 2000 to help complete the well. In 2003, Ryan’s family arranged to bring Jimmy to their home in Canada. ""We used to live as friends,"" Jimmy, now 17, says, ""but now we live as brothers."" The two teenagers hope their book will raise awareness about unsafe drinking water and prompt people to take action to help. ""The situation is difficult, but you have to start somewhere,"" Ryan says. ""We need to work harder to make the world a better place."" To find out how you can help Ryan and Jimmy bring safe drinking water to countries in need, go to More than two-thirds of Earth’s surface is covered in water, so you might think there is enough to go around. You may be surprised to learn that only a scarce, or limited, amount of the water is drinkable. Salty seawater makes up about 97 percent of the world’s water. Another 2 percent is frozen at the North and South poles. More than 1 billion people around the world don’t have access to safe drinking water, according to the United Nations. Why isn’t all the freshwater available to people safe for drinking? Chemicals from factories, fertilizers from farms, and untreated sewage pollute the water supply. ""One of our goals is to educate people about the importance of clean water,"" says Ryan. What are some ways you can help conserve water? measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.

172,2,"An escaped python is back in class. A sneaky snake has slithered out of hiding. Students and teachers at Hauppauge Middle School on Long Island, New York, are happy once again. Slim, their 2-foot-long ball python, is back in his tank in a science classroom. ""We were so used to seeing Slim every day that it seemed strange when he wasn’t there,"" sixth grader Brian Pattison told Earlier in the school year, teachers were putting Slim and Otis, another ball python, into their tank. Then the teachers became distracted by a disturbance in the hall, and the snakes escaped. The teachers quickly recaptured Otis. Slim, however, raced out into the hallway and disappeared. A search of the school began. ""Slim has been part of our school family for six years, so you can imagine how worried we were when he went missing,"" says school principal Maryann Fletcher. Ball pythons like heat, so school officials set up portable heaters. They also tried to lure the hungry snake out of hiding by providing boxes of tempting crickets. No one worried that Slim might hurt a person. Ball pythons are gentle snakes from western Africa. Four weeks after the escape, a night custodian found Slim. ""I am happy to say Slim the Snake has returned,"" wrote Fletcher in a note to parents.

Can these courses lead to a career in sport? - does your school have a swimming pool, Astroturf pitch, sports hall or tennis courts? - what sports activity does your school have outside of PE lessons? - are they positive? Do they have favourite sports? What if your favourite isn’t the same as theirs? - are you introduced to clubs in the area? Your school's links with local clubs can affect your participation Role models such as David Beckham, Tanni Grey-Thompson and Kelly Holmes have had a huge influence on participation in recent years. Women are now accepted as managers, officials and club directors although this was not always the case. Some sports, such as squash, have declined in popularity whilst women’s football and extreme sports are booming. Media coverage of sport affects participation levels.

174,4,"In November 1923, Hitler tried to take advantage of the crisis facing the Weimar government by instigating a in Munich. It seemed like the perfect opportunity, but poor planning and misjudgement resulted in failure and the subsequent imprisonment of Adolf Hitler. At first, the Nazis were just a terrorist group. Hitler assembled a large group of unemployed young men and former soldiers, known as the (the SA), which attacked other political groups. Hitler hoped to take power by starting a A complete or radical change. In political terms, revolution involves a radical change in government. During the crisis of 1923, therefore, Hitler plotted with two nationalist politicians - - to take over Munich in a revolution. Hitler is angered as Kahr and Lossow call off the rebellion Hitler collected his storm troopers and told them to be ready to rebel. Kahr and Lossow called off the rebellion . This was an impossible situation for Hitler, who had 3,000 troops ready to fight. Hitler waved a gun at Khar and Lossow On the night of 8 November 1923, Hitler and 600 storm troopers burst into a meeting that Kahr and Lossow were holding at the local . Waving a gun at them, Hitler forced them to agree to rebel - and then let them go home. The SA took over the army headquarters and the offices of the local newspaper. 16 Nazis were killed in the scuffle The next day, 9 November 1923, Hitler and his Nazis went into Munich on what they thought would be a triumphal march to take power. However, Kahr had called in police and army reinforcements. There was a short scuffle in which the police killed 16 Nazis. Why did Hitler attempt the Munich Putsch in 1923? By 1923, the Nazi party had 55,000 members and was Weimar government had called off the general strike , and every German nationalist was furious with the government. , but he knew he would lose control of them if he did not give them something to do. - the Italian fascist leader - who had come to power in Italy in 1922 by marching on Rome. , and Hitler was prevented from speaking in public until 1927. , where he wrote 'Mein Kampf'. Millions of Germans read it, and Hitler's ideas became very well-known. Hitler decided that he would never come to power by revolution; he realised that he would have to local branches of the party, which tried to get Nazis elected to the Reichstag the SS as his personal bodyguard, which was set up in 1925 It was this strategy of To become familiar with these events, identify the facts and arguments you would use to support these statements about the Munich Putsch: 'It was a squalid little failure that we would ignore nowadays if Hitler hadn't eventually come to power.' 'Hitler would have had no chance of ever gaining power without the failure of the Munich Putsch.' As part of your revision, think about the Hitler attempted the Munich Putsch in 1923. the Nazi Party was affected by the Munich Putsch. Think carefully about what the question is asking before you answer. A question on the Munich Putsch happened will need a very different answer to a question on the Munich Putsch affected the Nazi party. "
175,4,"If you are studying the higher paper, you will also need to know about tree diagrams, the and/or rule and conditional probabilities. Tree diagrams allow us to see all the possible outcomes of an event and calculate their probability. Each branch in a tree diagram represents a possible outcome. , the outcome of one has no effect on the outcome of the other. For example, if we toss two coins, getting heads with the first coin will not affect the probability of getting heads with the second. A tree diagram which represent a coin being tossed three times looks like this : From the tree diagram, we can see that there are eight possible outcomes. To find out the probability of a particular outcome, we need to look at all the available paths (set of branches). The sum of the probabilities for any set of branches is always 1. Also note that in a tree diagram to find a probability of an outcome we     P (H H H) =     P (2 Heads and a Tail) = P (H H T) + P (H T H) + P (T H H) Bag A contains three red marbles and four blue marbles. Bag B contains five red marbles and three blue marbles. A marble is taken from each bag in turn. Find the missing probabilities for the tree diagram: What is the probability of getting a blue bead followed by a red? What is the probability of getting a bead of each colour? P (blue and red or red and blue) = P (blue and red) + P (red and blue) , the outcome of one has no effect on the outcome of the other. When two events are said to be they cannot happen at the same time. For example, if a die is thrown, the events 'obtaining a 6' and 'obtaining a 1' are mutually exclusive, as they cannot happen at the same time. The events 'obtaining a six' and 'obtaining an even number' are mutually exclusive, because throwing a six fits into both categories. When two events, A and B, are P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B) When two events, A and B, are P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) sign for independent events, and the word sign for mutually exclusive events. This forms the basis of the A bag contains 5 green beads and 4 red beads. A bead is taken from the bag, its colour noted, and it is then replaced. A second bead is then taken from the bag. What is the probability that the two beads are different colours? The 1st bead is replaced before the 2nd bead is taken out, so the first and second beads are can be replaced by a multiplication sign. The events '1st is green and 2nd is red', or '1st is red and 2nd is green', are can be replaced by an addition sign. There are many pitfalls to using the rule in this way. Only do so if you are very confident about the method the question does not require the use of a tree diagram. rule will make sure you know when to add and when to multiply when calculating probabilities from tree diagrams. Conditional probability is when the probability of one event depends on a previous event - eg, if items are being picked from a bag in turn, but not replaced. A bag contains 4 red marbles and 5 green marbles. If we draw 2 marbles from the bag, then the colour of the second marble will be To work out the probabilities for the Here are two different sets of probabilities. Each set depends on which colour marble was taken out in the first event. If the first marble out of the bag is red, the probabilities for the P (second marble is red, given that the first marble was red) = P (second marble is green, given that the first marble was red) = However, if the first marble is green, there are four red and four green marbles left in the bag. P (second marble is red, given that the first marble was green) = P (second marble is green, given that the first marble was green) = . They are best represented on a tree diagram. After each event, the top and bottom numbers of the probability change. In this example, the bottom number will decrease by one each time an event occurs (one marble is removed). The easiest way to work out conditional probabilities is to draw a tree diagram with the probabilities on each branch. To find out the total probability of something which has a couple of possible outcomes, remember to add the probabilities together. Multiply along the branches to find each probability, and add together the outcomes. Remember that the sum of the probabilities for any set of branches should always be 1. From the tree diagram, we can see that: P (one marble of each colour) = The probability that Alex arrives home on time is If he does arrive home on time, the probability that his dinner is burnt is If he does not arrive home on time, the probability that his dinner is burnt is What is the probability that Alex arrives home on time and his dinner is not burnt? The probability that Alex arrives home on time and his dinner is not burnt is: What is the probability that Alex's dinner is burnt? 0.7 x 0.1 + 0.3 x 0.8 = 0.07 + 0.24 = 0.31 "

178,4,"Different species compete to survive and breed. The size of a predator population depends on the size of the prey population, and the reverse is true as well. Mutualism benefits both species involved in the relationship, but parasitism only benefits the parasite, not the host. Habitats have limited amounts of the resources needed by living organisms. Organisms must with others in order to get enough of these resources to survive. If they are unsuccessful and cannot move to another habitat, they will die. Some of the resources that animals compete for: Animals may also compete for mates so that they can reproduce. Remember that plants make their own food using photosynthesis is the process where green plants use water and carbon dioxide and sunlight to produce carbohydrates (stored energy) and release oxygen (as a by-product). , so they do not compete for food. Here are some of the things that plants do compete for: Human beings are very successful organisms. We compete with animals for food resources, and we compete with both animals and plants for space and water. are the animals that get eaten. The size of the predator population and prey population depend on each other. The Canadian lynx eats the snowshoe hare. The size of the two populations was estimated each year for 75 years from the number of animals caught by fur traders. There is a rise and fall in the snowshoe hare population with the lynx population following two years afterwards. No other cat is so dependent on a single prey species, which is why there is such a clear pattern of The predator/prey dynamic between canadian lynx and snowshoe hare populations If the prey population grows, predator numbers will respond to the increased food supply by increasing as well. But the growing predator population will eventually reduce the food supply to the point where it can no longer be sustained.

For this reason oxpeckers are called a - both species benefit from the arrangement. Lichens are another example of mutualism. They are formed by algae and fungi living together. Algae can photosynthesise and make food, which is shared by the fungus. The fungus in turn shelters the algae from a harsh climate. are organisms that live on or in a organism. The parasite benefits from this arrangement, but the host suffers as a result. Fleas are parasites. They live on the skin of other animals and suck their blood. This feeds the flea but weakens the host. A tapeworm lives inside another animal, attaching itself to the host’s gut and absorbing its food. The host loses nutrition, and may develop weight loss, diarrhoea and vomiting. Parasites do not usually kill the host, as this would cut off their food supply. plants. They have colonies of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in nodules attached to their roots. The plants gain nitrates from the bacteria, and the bacteria gain sugars from the plants. This is another example of mutualism. "

Other waves do not need to travel through a substance. They may be able to travel through a medium, but they do not have to. Visible light, infrared rays, microwaves and other types of Energy travelling as waves in the form of changing electrical and magnetic fields. are like this. They can travel through empty space. Electrical and magnetic fields vibrate as the waves travel. You should understand what is meant by the amplitude, wavelength and frequency of a wave. As waves travel, they set up patterns of disturbance. The amplitude of a wave is its maximum disturbance from its undisturbed position. Take care, the amplitude is not the distance between the top and bottom of a wave. The wavelength of a wave is the distance between a point on one wave and the same point on the next wave. It is often easiest to measure this from the crest of one wave to the crest of the next wave, but it doesn't matter where as long as it is the same point in each wave. The frequency of a wave is the number of waves produced by a source each second. It is also the number of waves that pass a certain point each second. The unit of frequency is the hertz (Hz). It is common for kilohertz (kHz), megahertz (MHz) and gigahertz (GHz) to be used when waves have very high frequencies. For example, most people cannot hear a high-pitched sound above 20kHz, radio stations broadcast Low frequency electromagnetic radiation used to transmit information such as television and radio programmes. with frequencies of about 100MHz, while most wireless computer networks operate at 2.4GHz.

It featured heavy rhythms, often distorted guitars and a fairly fast speed. produced heavier versions paving the way for Heavy Metal. was a highly theatrical style developed in the 1970s by , who often wore glamorous costumes and heavy make up and through this achieved a controversial androgynous look. The songs were short with catchy hooks and melodies and an emphasis on a rock 'n roll sound. : the most popular dance style of the 1970's, disco developed from the Motown sound. Good examples are: . Disco was at its peak on the release of the film . Steady bass drum beats were a feature of disco music. Disco is still very popular and can be heard in many night clubs around the world. often associated with Disco, Funk music featured Horn (brass) sections, syncopated rhythms and vocal group harmonies. were some bands playing in this style. Reggae began in 1968 with the release of 'Do the Reggay' by took the 'Ska' music of the shantytowns in Kingston, Jamaica, slowed the tempo and introduced a much heavier bass whilst retaining the strong upbeat, his name became synonymous with Reggae. Dub reggae was developed by Jamaican 'deejays' who began to rap over the instrumental B-sides of Reggae singles to make a new, Dub version of the song. Dub reggae in turn evolved into Reggae deejay or Dancehall music. In the 1990's this style evolved further with Electro dub reggae which had a synthesised bass line, and was a big hit on the London club scene. music - not too challenging and appealing to many different tastes.

Synth continued in the late 1970s with , and into the 1980s with bands like Heavy Metal was highly amplified form of electronic rock with a hard beat, distorted guitar and frequent long instrumental solos. Bands such as and many others played in this style. take this music even further, with a harder and faster playing style. This was a development of 1970s rock music with elaborate guitar solos and a heavy beat. Examples are U2, The Police, Bryan Adams, Bruce Springsteen Punk music was raw, abrasive and fast. Distorted guitars were played wildly and the lyrics were often designed to shock. Recent years have seen a revival of American punk with bands such as This music developed from synth pop and featured synthesisers and drum machines. New Romantic bands such as had a huge following in the early 1980's. This has a very polished pop sound and bands often wore glamorous clothes and make-up. Rap uses the spoken word as a rhythmic instrument. Rap DJs often use scratching and back spinning on vinyl discs to create the sound style for the vocalist to rap over. Its roots are in the toasting of Jamaican DJs who spoke over rhythm and blues records, and in New York black street culture - where it went together with graffiti art,Hip-Hop and Break Dancing (so called because of the break-beats or short rhythmic phrases mixed together by 1970s DJs). It was often a highly political style whose lyrics could include very controversial statements. rapped about black social issues, making political statements about black rights, racism and police brutality. also rapped about contentious topics, and started Gangster Rap. The music crossed over to a much larger - indeed world-wide - audience with the band whose records were a hit with white audiences as well as black. Techno was a specific form of dance music - influenced by both Disco music and Dub - developed by DJs in the dance clubs of Detroit. It featured samples or cuts from tracks, loops and digital effects produced on synthesisers and computers - together with driving, repetitive drum-and-bass lines. House music (named from the Warehouse club in Chicago) was developed by DJs out of Disco and Dub in the early 1980s. UK House hits of the late 1980s included 'Love Can't Turn Around' and 'Jack Your Body'. Records like this made stars of the DJs and engineers who produced and played the music. A later spin-off was Acid House, which featured a wobbly baseline and trance-like sound and was very influential in the UK Rave scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s. From the 1990s onwards electronic dance music spawned numerous variants including Techno Trance, Goa Trance, Dub, Hardcore and Gabba. In the mid 1990s a different dance music form, Jungle became popular, this grew around the London club scene, and is influenced by Techno, Hip-hop and Ragga. It is now known as Drum and Bass and features a fast tumbling beat and an emphasis on the drum and bass sounds, a good example is music by Grunge was a hard-sounding rock-based music pioneered by American bands mostly based in Seattle in the north-west United States: Grunge was a reaction against American soft rock by a disillusioned and bored 'Generation X'. Its lyrics often dealt with difficult issues such as drugs and mental illness. committed suicide in 1994 he was quickly elevated to cult status. Brit Pop arrived in the early 1990s in part as a reaction to the dominance of American Grunge bands. It was usually guitar-and-drum based rock, sometimes with orchestral backing. Though varying in musical style, bands such as Brit Pop is an eclectic sound drawing on many musical styles of the previous 40 years - especially the music of , Mod bands of the 60s like As with The Stones and The Beatles, some Brit Pop bands achieved success in America and emerged as 'superstars'. These are highly 'produced' bands carefully designed to appeal to a specific, usually young-teenage audience.

184,4,"Electricity is generated when a coil of wire moves in a magnetic field. This is the basis of electricity generators. Most electricity is made in power stations by burning fuels. Transformers are used in the National Grid to reduce energy losses from the wires during transmission. An electric current is produced when a magnet is moved into a coil of wire in a circuit. The direction of the current is reversed when the magnet is moved out of the coil. It can also be reversed if the other pole of the magnet is moved into the coil. Check your understanding of the Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

Notice that no current is induced when the magnet is still, even if it is inside the coil. increase the number of turns on the coil Batteries produce direct current, or DC, electricity. The current flows in the same direction all of the time, as shown by this typical voltage-time graph. Generators produce alternating current, or AC, electricity. The current reverses direction regularly, as shown by this typical voltage-time graph. Mains electricity is AC. It has a frequency of 50Hz - 50 cycles per second. When a wire is moved in a magnetic field, the movement, magnetic field and current are all at right angles to each other. If the wire is moved in the opposite direction, the induced current also moves in the opposite direction. One side of a coil in a generator moves up during one half-turn, and then down during the next half-turn. This means that, as a coil is rotated in a magnetic field, the induced current reverses direction every half-turn. About three-quarters of the electricity which is generated in the UK comes from power stations that are fuelled by fossil fuels. the fuel is burned to boil water to make steam the spinning turbine turns a generator which produces electricity the electricity goes to the transformers to produce the correct voltage Power stations generate significant heat losses to the environment. Below is an energy transfer diagram for the generation of electricity from a fossil fuel such as coal: Energy transfer for the generation of electricity from a fossil fuel A transformer is an electrical device that changes the voltage of an AC supply. A transformer changes a high-voltage supply into a low-voltage one, or vice versa: a transformer that increases the voltage is called a a transformer that decreases the voltage is called a Step-down transformers are used in mains adapters and rechargers for mobile phones and CD players. When a current flows through a wire, some energy is lost as heat. The higher the current, the more heat is lost. To reduce these losses, the National Grid transmits electricity at a low current. This requires a high voltage. Power stations produce electricity at 25,000V. Electricity is sent through the National Grid cables at 400,000V, 275,000V and 132,000V. Step-up transformers at power stations produce the very high voltages needed to transmit electricity through the National Grid power lines. These high voltages are too dangerous to use in the home, so step-down transformers are used locally to reduce the voltage to safe levels. The energy input and output of a power station can be summarised by this equation: fuel energy input = waste energy output + electrical energy output For a given input of energy from a fuel, the more waste energy output, the less electrical energy output. How much electrical energy is output from an input of 1,000J if 600J is wasted? fuel energy input = waste energy output + electrical energy output = fuel energy input - waste energy output efficiency = electrical energy output ÷ fuel energy input "

If so, you may want to think twice the next time. Experts say even one extra hour of sleep a night counts. A recent study showed that extra sleep can help kids perform better in school. For two nights, a group of kids who took part in the study went to bed at their usual bedtime. Afterward, they were given tests for memory and attention span. Both of those things are important for learning in school. On the third night, some kids went to bed one hour earlier than usual. Others went to bed one hour later. The next day, experts tested the kids again. Here is what the experts found: The kids who slept an extra hour improved their test scores. Some kids did better by as much as two grade levels! The kids who lost an hour of sleep did not improve their scores. Most third graders need at least nine hours of sleep each night, say experts. However, studies show that many kids are not sleeping enough. That can make it hard for kids to pay attention in school. Going to bed early is not easy, experts agree. But it’s worth it! One extra hour of sleep may mean the difference between doing well and falling asleep in class.

A wingspan is the distance from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other. The reptile also had a sharp, pointy beak and curved, birdlike claws. The reptile's small size may have had advantages. Scientists say being small may have allowed to hide from animals that eat other animals. Its size may have also helped it find food. Because it was small, the reptile could ""be [quicker] to catch insects,"" scientist Xiaolin Wang told . Wang was on the team that discovered the pterosaur. Scientists plan to study the reptile's fossil in more detail. They hope it will offer clues about how pterosaurs changed over time. ""They are ancestors of the large pterosaurs,"" Wang says. Pterosaurs ranged in size from as small as a bird to as big as an airplane. Here are three different kinds of pterosaurs. This pterosaur's wingspan was about 4 feet. It also had a huge head, and its legs could stretch out. This pterosaur was about 6 feet long with a wingspan of 20 to 25 feet. This is the largest pterosaur ever found.

188,4,"Data can be obtained by taking measurements, and can lead to an explanation of why materials have different properties. During an experiment other factors, which could affect the outcome, need to be controlled. Many people may have ideas about why materials have different properties, but these opinions are not very useful if they are not supported by data. To justify an explanation, you need to have data to support it. This data may be obtained by taking measurements. The table below shows the length that equal-sized samples of one type of rubber can be stretched before they break: of each measurement depends on the quality of the measuring apparatus and the skill of the scientists taking the measurement. If the apparatus is faulty, or the scientists make a mistake, the measurement may be inaccurate. , the variation within the values must be small. There is always some variation in any set of measurements, whatever is being measured. There may be small differences in the composition of the rubber or the way the measuring apparatus is used. In this set of data, each measurement is only slightly different from the others. The results are repeatable, meaning that each time a measurement is taken it has approximately the same value. We can say that this set of data is reliable. A number of factors, also known as , may have an effect on the outcome of an experiment. of samples of different types of rubber. This scientist is using a machine to stretch the rubber to measure its tensile strength. Hang a mass from the bottom of each sample and record the new length. Increase the mass in increments and continue to measure the length, until the rubber snaps. The largest amount that the rubber stretched before breaking is a measure of its tensile strength. In this experiment, the factor that is being investigated is the is the maximum increase in the length of the rubber before it breaks. A positive feature of the design of this experiment is that other factors, which might also affect the amount by which the rubber stretches, are controlled. If these other factors were not controlled, this would be a design flaw in the experiment. Again, the table below shows the length that equal-sized samples of one type of rubber can be stretched to before they break. The highest and lowest values in a set of measurements show the range. The range of this set of measurements is 23 to 27. This may also be written as 23 - 27. The less variation in the measurements, the more reliable they are. In other words, the smaller the range, the more The results from all of the samples can be added together, and then the total divided by the number of samples. This gives a value called the ‘mean’. 27 + 24 + 26 + 25 + 23 = 125 This value for the mean gives a best estimate of the length that this rubber can be stretched before it breaks. This is a measure of the By measuring this length for several samples and then calculating the mean, the scientists get a better estimate of the tensile strength of the rubber. They can also see how reliable the data is. The table below shows the length that equal-sized samples of another type of rubber can be stretched before they break. In this set of data, the results for samples 1, 2, 4 and 5 are very close to each other, but sample 3 is very different to the others. It is an . Perhaps the apparatus malfunctioned when this measurement was taken, or perhaps the person taking the measurement made a mistake. If only one sample was used, it might be incorrect, but it would still be used as the best estimate. If several samples are used, the incorrect ones (the outliers) can be ignored. The others are used to calculate the mean, which is then used as the best estimate. Mean = (38 + 35 + 34 + 37) / 4 = 144/4 = 36 for this data set is 34 to 38, not 34 to 66. The outlier has been ignored for both the mean and the range. Read on if you are taking the The table below shows the length that equal-sized samples of two different types of rubber can be stretched before they break. This is a measure of the tensile strength of the rubber. The data in the table shows that there is a real difference between the tensile strengths of these two types of rubber. the mean for rubber type A data lies outside the range for rubber type B data the mean for rubber type B data lies outside the range for rubber type A data The mean of the measurements from rubber type C is within the range of the measurements from rubber type D. Therefore, there is not a real difference between the tensile strengths of these two types of rubber. Note that none of the sets of data on this page has an outlier. To measure the tensile strength of samples of different types of rubber, first of all the length of each sample is measured. Then a mass is hung from the bottom of each sample, and the new length measured. The mass is increased in increments, and the new length of the rubber measured each time, until the rubber snaps. The largest amount the rubber stretches before breaking is a measure of its tensile strength. In this investigation there are several factors, also called variables, which may affect the outcome. These include the: The factor that is being assessed is the type of rubber. In a good experimental design, all of the other factors are , ie kept constant, for all of the samples tested. If the other factors are not controlled, they may have an effect on the outcome. This means that any measured effect on the outcome could be the result of one of these other factors, rather than the factor that is being assessed. The results of the investigation would then be "

These are constantly moving at a few centimetres each year. Although this doesn't sound like very much, over millions of years the movement allows whole continents to shift thousands of kilometres apart. This process is called in the Earth's mantle. These are driven by the heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements and heat left over from the formation of the Earth. Where tectonic plates meet, the Earth's crust becomes unstable as the plates push against each other, or ride under or over each other. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions happen at the boundaries between plates, and the crust may ‘crumple’ to form mountain ranges. from 2006 about the 100th anniversary of San Francisco’s great earthquake. It is difficult to predict exactly when an earthquake might happen and how bad it will be, even in places known for having earthquakes. The theory of plate tectonics and continental drift were proposed at the beginning of the last century by a German scientist, Alfred Wegener. Before his time it was believed that the planet's features, such as mountains, were caused by the crust shrinking as the Earth cooled after it was formed. It took more than 50 years for Wegener’s theory to be accepted. This was because it was difficult to work out what the mechanism was that could make whole continents move, and it was not until the 1960s that enough evidence was discovered to support the theory fully.

These written materials are examples for revision practice only. They are not from any exam papers. Heart disease is the largest cause of death for people living in England. Approximately one in five of all deaths is caused by heart disease. However, heart disease does not affect all people equally. Some people are more likely to have heart disease than others. for heart disease include age, sex, diet, smoking, high blood pressure and cholesterol. They can even include how much you earn and what type of education you had. Look at the graph. It shows the incidence of heart disease in different members of the population depending on how much money they earn.

Describe the correlation between deaths from heart disease and wealth. Suggest one factor that might increase the chance of a poor person getting heart disease. Suggest why not all poor people will get heart disease. To establish the reliability of the data in the graph it needs to be peer reviewed. Explain what is meant by 'peer review'. Look at the table of data about heart disease. sample tested with coronary heart disease (per cent) stopped education at 16 years of age had some education after 16 years of age Suggest why scientists regard it as important that this data is peer reviewed. The data was produced from a questionnaire of 100 people that included 50 males who smoked and 50 females who did not smoke. Comment on the size of the sample, how well the samples were matched and why some of the data does not match the bar chart at the top of the page. Suggest how scientists could design a study to show that a high fat diet increases the risk of developing heart disease. Wendy looked at the data and thought that the data did not show a plausible mechanism for the acceptance or rejection of a Peter looked at the data and concluded that women were more likely to get heart disease than men. The poorer you are, the more likely you are to get heart disease. eating a cheaper diet that may contain more unhealthy foods not having access to good health care being more likely to live in an unhealthy environment do not have the genes that could increase the chances of getting heart disease The data obtained by one scientist is checked and replicated by another scientist to see if they get the same results and conclusion. To ensure that the data is reliable and the conclusions drawn are consistent. The sample size was too small to be statistically significant and the sample sizes were not matched. Therefore the data is unreliable and so does not match the data about the numbers of men compared with women who have heart disease. Use a large sample of people, half on a low fat diet and half on a high fat diet. Then either randomise the selection or ensure that both samples are the same for as many variables as possible eg age, sex, non-smoking, and so on. Yes. There is nothing to show why heart disease would increase with age or lack of further education. No, because there are more women than men in the population to start with. Proportionately the data shows they are both the same. "

Shaw, who is blind, said he felt like Cuddles from a television program. Shaw and his wife contacted the Guide Horse foundation in Kittrell, North Carolina. ""Horses make excellent guides,"" said trainer Janet Burleson. ""It is very common in the wild state for a blind horse to bond to a sighted horse that it uses as it' guide."" Guide horses are usually between 26 and 27 inches tall and weigh between 80 and 100 pounds-about the same size as many guide dogs. However, not just any small horse can be a guide horse, says Burleson. It needs to have the right personality and intelligence level. Like a guide dog, Cuddles has been house trained. She will tap her hoof on the door when she needs to go outside. Unlike guide dog, however, she doesn't sleep in the house. Instead, she sleeps in a small barn. Shaw says that everyone wants to pet Cuddles because the tiny horse is so cute. But people should not pet Cuddles or any other service animal. Petting can distract a guide animal from its job of keeping a blind person safe. Cuddles and Shaw have traveled many places together, including the Empire State Building in New York City. ""Every time I hear the gasps of amazement from an onlooker who has just realized that Cuddles is not a guide dog, I smile Shaw says.

197,4,"Methane and carbon dioxide are greenhouse gases. They absorb heat energy and prevent it escaping into space. This keeps the Earth warmer than it would be without these gases. Remember that the Moon and the Earth are the same distance from the Sun. The Moon has no atmosphere and has an average surface temperature of –18ºC, while the Earth has an average surface temperature of 14ºC. So you can see that greenhouse gases are not a bad thing in themselves, but too much of them in the atmosphere leads to global warming. Rice paddy fields produce methane gas, and so do cattle. As the numbers of rice fields and cattle have increased, so has the amount of methane in the atmosphere. Fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil, are mined from the earth. They are formed from broken down animals and plants that died a very long time ago. Fossil fuels are burnt to produce energy. Often they are used to create electricity. As they can only be used once, these are called finite fuels. . You may wish to check your understanding of this by looking at the chemistry section on When land is cleared for timber and farms, there are fewer trees to perform the important task of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by photosynthesis. In addition, if the fallen trees are burned or left to rot, additional carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere. These factors are particularly important in tropical areas, where forests might be cleared to make way for cattle farms. Then, not only are there fewer trees left to absorb carbon dioxide, but the graphburning trees release carbon dioxide and the cattle release methane. As the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has increased, so too has the average global temperature. This is what scientists mean when they talk of global warming. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen at a higher rate since the 19th century The temperature of the earth has risen over the years An increase of only a few degrees will cause changes to the Earth’s climate, and lead to sea levels rising.

Water that is not put back into the blood is excreted in our urine. from food and drinks. We even get some water when we respire by burning glucose to release energy. in sweat, faeces, urine and when we breathe out (on a cold day you can see this water as it condenses into vapour). For the cells of our body to work properly, it is important that their water content is maintained at the correct level. This means our body must maintain a balance between the water we take in and the water we lose. This is done by the Humans have two kidneys. They are bean-shaped organs, approximately 11.5cm long, that are situated in the abdominal cavity, just below the ribcage, one on either side of the spine. Blood is brought to the kidneys to be filtered, and then returned, to be circulated around the body. As the blood passes through the kidneys, all the small molecules are urea (a waste product from the breakdown of proteins) The kidneys then reabsorb all of the and as much water and salt as the body needs, putting them back into the blood.

202,4,"Food chains show the feeding relationships in a habitat. Pyramids of biomass are charts that show the mass of living organisms at each step in a food chain. Energy is lost moving up in a food chain, and this limits the length of the chain - so it's more efficient to feed people with plants than with meat. Organisms usually compete with each other for resources. The populations of predators and prey are interrelated. A food chain shows who eats what in a particular habitat. For example, grass seed is eaten by a vole, which is eaten by a barn owl. The arrows between each item in the chain always point from the food to the feeder. This is the direction in which energy flows in the food chain. , which are almost always green plants. The other organisms in the food chain are – they all get their energy and biomass by consuming (eating) other organisms. Most food chains are quite short, and they rarely consist of more than four steps. This is because a lot of energy is lost at each step. After about three steps, very little energy is still available for use by living organisms. This also explains why there are few organisms at the top of food chains, compared with those lower down. The dry mass of an organism is called its . The total biomass at a particular step in a food chain is always less than the total biomass at the step before it. Let's look again at the A sequence (usually shown as a diagram) of feeding relationships between organisms, showing who eats what and the movement of energy through trophic levels. The biomass of all the grass plants is the greatest in the chain, and the biomass of all the barn owls is the least. We can show information like this using a Let's look at a more complex food chain: oak tree → caterpillar → blue tit → sparrow hawk Oak trees are very large, but caterpillars are very small. One oak tree can feed many caterpillars, but many caterpillars are needed to feed a blue tit, and many blue tits are needed to feed a sparrow hawk. If we draw a for this food chain, it looks like . Note there's only one oak tree, but lots of caterpillars indicated by the shape of the pyramid. The wider the bar, the more organisms there are. Remember that energy is lost at each step in a food chain. . Note the large biomass of the one oak tree, compared with the small biomass of lots of caterpillars, indicated by the shape of the pyramid. The wider the bar, the more biomass there is. Pyramids of biomass always have this shape (but pyramids of numbers can be any shape). Efficiency of food production and organic farming The amount of available energy decreases at every step in a A sequence (usually shown as a diagram) of feeding relationships between organisms, showing who eats what and the movement of energy through trophic levels. . Some energy goes into growth in any organic, non-fossil material - eg vegetable matter or animal waste - which can be used as fuel. An example would be generation of gas from decomposing organic waste. and the production of offspring, but most is used up in other ways: sunlight is reflected off leaves instead of being used for photosynthesis energy is lost through respiration as heat energy is lost because of excretion and defecation energy is used for movement and transport It is far more efficient for humans to eat cereals such as wheat and barley themselves, rather than to use the cereals to feed cattle and then to slaughter the cattle for beef. This is because the energy in the beef has already passed through two steps by the time it gets to humans, and at each step the amount of available energy is reduced. When we eat cereals (or vegetables or fruit) the energy has only passed through one step, and there has only been Organic farming involves producing food without the need for artificial fertilisers and pesticides - this may be better for people's general health, but it may also mean crop yields are smaller. Organic food is often more expensive compared to food produced by normal 'intensive' farming methods because: organic produce may be more difficult to transport without being spoiled Places inhabited by communities of living things. have limited amounts of the resources needed by the living organisms who live in them. Animal (including humans) and plant organisms can only survive if they can get enough resources from their habitat, and they must compete with other organisms for these resources. If they are unsuccessful and cannot move to another habitat, they will die. Here are some of the resources that animals compete for: Animals may also compete for mates, so that they can reproduce. Remember that plants make their own food, using photosynthesis is the process where green plants use water and carbon dioxide and sunlight to produce carbohydrates (stored energy) and release oxygen (as a by-product). , so they do not compete for food. Here are some of the things that plants Human beings are very successful organisms. We compete with other animals and with plants all over the world. For example, our farmers compete with animals and plants for water and space, and with animals for food.

Predator Used in the classification of living organisms, referring to related organisms capable of interbreeding. need to be adapted for efficient hunting if they are to catch enough food to survive. Prey species, on the other hand, must be well adapted to escape their predators, if enough of them are to survive for the species to continue. A group of members of a single species living in a habitat. in an ecosystem grows, predator numbers will respond to the increased food supply by increasing as well. Growing predator numbers will eventually reduce the food supply to the point where it can no longer sustain the predator population ... and so on. between a population of ladybirds (predators) and a population of aphids (their prey).

From this meeting arose key statements by the five faiths outlining their own distinctive traditions and approach to the care for nature. In the Assisi Declarations on Nature of 1986 the Hindu statement was: The human role is not separate from nature. All objects in the universe, beings and non-beings, are pervaded by the same spiritual power. The human race, though at the top of the evolutionary pyramid at present, is not seen as something apart from earth and its many forms. People did not spring fully formed to dominate lesser life, but evolved out of these forms and are integrally linked with them. and the divine is expressed through all its forms.

For instance, the spy who manages to stop the bomb two seconds before it explodes. , where we are fairly sure about something, but in the final part everything changes. For example, we then learn that this is a fake bomb, and the real one is hidden somewhere else and will explode in five minutes. , where the story stops, but we aren't sure what has actually happened at the end. For instance, the bomb is defused and everyone is safe. But then an army commander reports the theft of another bomb... only this time twice as powerful. However, there are two endings to avoid: , where a bomb will inevitably explode and as it does, the narrator wakes up - it was all a dream. Some English teachers don't mind this sort of thing, but others hate it. You have been warned. , where the secret agent suddenly stops worrying about the bomb, retires, and goes off to play golf. This is even worse, and no-one likes it because the ending has nothing to do with the story. Whatever kind of story you write, decide on your ending and include it in your plan.

215,2,"How hard will the flu hit this season? U.S. health officials aren't sure, but they fear the number of cases may be higher than usual. There has been a shortage of flu this year. A flu vaccine is a substance that helps fight the flu. Most people get the vaccine in the form of flu shots. Others get it in the form of nose sprays. This year, only two companies made flu vaccine for the United States. One of the two companies found that its supply, which was being made in England, was damaged. That company was supposed to provide the United States with half of the 100 million doses of flu vaccine expected. . A virus is a tiny organism that makes people sick when it invades cells in the body and multiplies. Flu season typically runs from November through March. Fever, a cough, a headache, and muscle aches are among the flu's many signs, or There isn't a cure for the flu. Yet health officials say that the flu vaccine can help keep people from catching the bug. Scientists have to create a new flu vaccine each year. That is because the , or type, of flu virus changes from year to year. Due to the shortage of flu vaccine, the people at highest risk will get a flu shot first. Because of the shortage, the people at highest risk will get the vaccine first. That group includes adults 65 and over, kids 6 to 23 months, and people with serious medical conditions. The vaccine was sent to doctors' offices that care for high-risk patients. Despite the shortage of flu vaccine, doctors say that there are ways to stay healthy. The flu spreads through the air when infected people sneeze or cough. The virus also can spread on the hands of an infected person. Here's how to stop germs from spreading: Wash hands regularly with soap and warm water. Use a tissue to cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze. If there isn't a tissue handy, cough or sneeze into your sleeve. Using your hand may spread the germs. Practice healthful habits, such as eating right, getting plenty of rest, and exercising.

216,2,"Condoleezza Rice is the first African American woman to become secretary of state. After the November election, President Bush nominated Condoleezza Rice to become secretary of state. That is the highest job in the president's Rice will make history as the first-ever African American woman secretary of state. ""The secretary of state is America's face to the world, and in [Condoleezza Rice] the world will see the strength, grace, and decency of our country,"" Bush told reporters. Being a leader is nothing new to Rice. In 2001, Rice was the first African American woman to become national security adviser. In that position, she worked closely with President Bush and advised him on defense matters. As secretary of state, Rice will advise President Bush on U.S. foreign affairs. She will serve as a top . A diplomat is a person who represents his or her country abroad. Rice will also work with leaders of other countries on important issues, such as the war in Iraq and the rebuilding of South Asia after the tsunami. Rice has overcome odds to make it to one of the country's top jobs. She was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1954, during a time when black people were , or separated, from white people in the South. Rice says her parents taught her that education was the best way to overcome segregation. At 15, she attended college at the University of Denver in Colorado. Bush believes that Rice, a classical pianist and former competitive ice skater, is up to the challenge. ""It is an honor to be asked to serve ... my country once again,"" said Rice. The president's Cabinet is made up of a group of leaders who are in charge of the 15 departments in the executive branch of the government. The president heads up that branch. The Senate must approve President Bush's Cabinet choices. Not everyone agrees with the president's choices for those positions.

217,4,"You should remember from your Key Stage 3 studies that white light can be split up into a spectrum of many different colours. You should know that visible light is just part of a continuous spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. Different types of electromagnetic radiation have different hazards and uses. Using a prism, you can split up white light to form a spectrum. A prism is a block of glass with a triangular cross-section. The light waves are refracted as they enter and leave the prism. The shorter the wavelength of the light, the more it is refracted. As a result, red light is refracted the least and violet light is refracted the most, causing the coloured light to spread out to form a spectrum. Visible light is just one type of electromagnetic radiation. There are various types of electromagnetic radiation with longer wavelengths of light than red light and with shorter wavelengths than violet light. All the different types of electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed through space. X-rays, visible light and radio waves are all types of electromagnetic radiation. travel at the same speed in a vacuum - empty space The speed of electromagnetic radiation in a vacuum is 299,792,458 m/s. This is approximately three hundred million metres per second - nearly nine hundred thousand times faster than sound, which is why you see a flash of lightning before you hear the thunder. Over-exposure to certain types of electromagnetic radiation can be harmful. The higher the frequency of the radiation, the more damage it is likely to cause to the body: microwaves cause internal heating of body tissues infrared radiation is felt as heat and causes skin burns X-rays damage cells, causing mutations (which may lead to cancer) and cell death gamma rays also damage cells, causing mutations (which may lead to cancer) and cell death Microwave radiation can be used to transmit signals such as those for mobile phone calls. Microwave transmitters and receivers on buildings and masts communicate with the mobile phones in their range. There is concern that microwave radiation from mobile phones and masts may be harmful to health. Ultraviolet radiation - UV - is found naturally in sunlight. We cannot see or feel ultraviolet radiation, but our skin responds to it by turning darker. This happens as our bodies attempt to reduce the amount of ultraviolet radiation reaching deeper skin tissues. Darker skins absorb more ultraviolet light, so less ultraviolet radiation reaches the deeper tissues. This is important, because ultraviolet radiation can cause normal cells to become cancerous. The three main types of ultraviolet radiation, and some of their effects causes severe sunburn and damage to cells The coloured part of your eye, the iris, has a unique pattern. Visible light reflected off the iris can be analysed by a computer and compared to stored patterns. In this way, people can be identified by their iris pattern. All objects give off or emit infrared radiation. The hotter the object, the more infrared radiation it emits. Sensors that can detect this radiation allow the temperature of objects to be measured. This is useful for medical scans to detect abnormally hot parts of the body, which may indicate damage or illness. The detection of infrared emissions is also useful for tracking criminals at night and for military 'night vision' goggles. Materials absorb different types of electromagnetic radiation to different degrees. are weakly absorbed by skin and muscle, but strongly absorbed by dense material such as bone and metal. This means that X-rays can be used to produce images of bones inside your body, to check for damage such as fractures. X-rays are also used in industry to check metal components and welds for cracks or other damage. radiation is absorbed by water molecules, so it can be used for cooking. Water in the food absorbs the microwave radiation, which causes the water to heat up and cook the food. Microwaves are also used to monitor rain. Satellites have been set up to measure how much microwave radiation, sent from ground-based transmitters, is absorbed by water in the atmosphere. Computers analyse the information and build up a picture of the rain and cloud. light is used to detect forged bank notes. Certain chemicals in paper absorb ultraviolet light and emit the energy as blue light. Real bank notes have invisible markings that only show up using ultraviolet light. "
218,1,"Animal experts say that we should give overweight pets less food. Fluffy and Fido may need your help. Many cats and dogs in the United States are too fat, scientists report. Like people, overweight pets are at risk for health problems. How did all those cats and dogs get so pudgy? Their owners are feeding them too much food! ""If you can feel the ribs under your pet’s skin but not see them, your pet is a perfect weight,"" animal expert Karen Volkerts told What should you do if your cat or dog is too heavy? Give your pet less food, say animal experts. Pudgy pets can be given smaller meals or diet pet food. Regular exercise also keeps pets from becoming couch potatoes. Owners often share their food with their pets. ""Dogs and cats have their own special food for a reason. They don’t digest human food well,"" said Volkerts.

219,1,"Tough Talkin'!: Discussing Bullies and Other Problems It's not easy being a kid. That's what a recent national survey of kids and parents revealed. Bullying and violence at school are just some of the problems facing many kids today. How can kids cope with such tough issues? ""Tough issues are facing kids at younger ages,"" said Tina Hoff of the Kaiser Family Foundation. The group is a children's health organization. The foundation, Children Now (a children's research group), and Nickelodeon asked children ages 8 to 15 and parents to point out the tough issues kids deal with every day. The survey, called Talking With Kids About Tough Issues, found that about seven out of ten kids say bullying and teasing are problems at their school. about four out of ten kids say kids at their school face threats of violence. about seven out of ten kids in the survey say they are too embarrassed about their problems to talk to parents. Other issues children say are problems at school include smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, and using drugs. The survey found that when parents talk early about tough issues, kids learn to trust them more. Those kids who learn to talk to parents learn how to deal with problems that bother them.

221,2,"What a difference a year can make. Last winter, monarch butterflies died off in record numbers. This year, researchers are reporting that these delicate creatures have made an impressive comeback. The overall monarch butterfly population is recovering. The healthy number of monarchs has many scientists puzzled. ""It's amazing that they recovered so well,"" said butterfly expert Bill Calvert. In January 2002, a severe storm killed millions of monarchs that were spending the winter in Mexico. ""The data this winter indicates that the monarchs are moving back toward their average population size,"" said Lincoln Brower, another butterfly expert. The data collected this winter shows that monarch , or groups, covered about 20 acres of forests in Mexico. That is close to the average number of 24 acres from 1993 to 2001. After last year's unusual winter storm, the colonies covered only about 5 acres. , or move, south from the United States and Canada to their winter homes in the mountains of Mexico. The orange-and- black monarch butterflies return to the United States and Canada in the spring. Butterfly experts and the Mexican government are concerned that illegal logging is destroying the monarchs' , or home. They are worried because one of the top layers of the forest, called the , acts as an umbrella to protect monarchs. Illegally cutting down trees thins the canopy. Without the canopy, monarchs are exposed to cold, wet weather, which can kill them. Government officials in Mexico are working with environmental groups to stop illegal logging and save the forests.

230,4,"When reversible reactions reach equilibrium the forward and reverse reactions are still happening but at the same rate, so the concentrations of reactants and products do not change. The balance point can be affected by temperature, and also by pressure for gasses in equilibrium. If a chemical reaction happens in a container where one or more of the substances present at the start of a chemical reaction A product is a substance formed in a chemical reaction. . If a chemical reaction happens in a container where none of the reactants or products can escape, you have a Reversible reactions are chemical reactions which can go both ways. The direction of the reaction depends on the condition of the reactants. that happen in a closed system eventually reach an In a chemical equilibrium, the concentrations of reactants and products do not change. But the forward and reverse reactions have not stopped - they are still going on at the same rate as each other Imagine walking the wrong way on an escalator - at the same speed as the escalator, but in the opposite direction. Your legs would still be walking forwards, and the escalator would continue to move backwards. However, the net result would be that you stay in exactly the same place. This is what happens in an equilibrium. If we remove the products from an equilibrium mixture, more reactants are converted into products. If a A catalyst changes the rate of a chemical reaction without being changed by the reaction itself. is used, the reaction reaches equilibrium much sooner, because the catalyst speeds up the forward and reverse reactions by the same amount. The concentration of reactants and products is nevertheless the same at equilibrium as it would be without the catalyst. Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

For the Higher Tier, you need to know what happens to the amount of product in an equilibrium mixture if the Heat energy is released in an exothermic reaction. We know this because the surroundings get warm. and the temperature is increased, the yield of products is decreased. If the temperature is decreased, the yield of products is increased. In an endothermic reaction, energy is taken in from the surroundings. The surroundings then have less energy than they started with, so the temperature falls. and the temperature is increased, the yield of products is increased. If the temperature is decreased, the yield of products is decreased. Haber process - effect of temperature change on yield of ammonia This is important to industrial processes such as the Haber process. The forward reaction, which makes ammonia for fertilisers, is exothermic. So the yield of ammonia is better at lower temperatures. You might think that chemical engineers would choose a low temperature for the Haber process - but the reaction runs much faster at higher temperatures. So a compromise temperature is chosen - one that is high enough to get a reasonable rate of reaction, but not so high that the yield of ammonia is low. The Haber process - choosing a temperature The forward reaction in the Haber process is Heat energy is released in an exothermic reaction. We know this because the surroundings get warm. . This means that if the temperature is increased, the position of equilibrium moves in the direction of the reverse reaction, and less ammonia is formed.

The effect of varying the temperature in the Haber process You might think that a low temperature would be a good choice for the Haber process: if the forward reaction is exothermic, the yield of product at If the rate of the forward reaction and the rate of the back reaction in a reversible reaction are equal, the reaction is in equilibrium. is increased at lower temperatures. However, if the temperature is too low the rate of reaction will be too low. This would make the process uneconomical. So a compromise temperature is chosen: low enough to get a good yield of ammonia but high enough to obtain a reasonable rate of reaction. A catalyst changes the rate of a chemical reaction without being changed by the reaction itself. does not affect the position of the equilibrium, but it does increase the rate of the reaction. This means the ammonia is produced in a shorter time, reducing the cost of the process. Iron is a cheap catalyst. For the Higher Tier, you also need to know what happens to the amount of A product is a substance formed in a chemical reaction. in an equilibrium mixture of gases if the Changing the pressure has little effect on an equilibrium mixture without gases - but can have a big effect on an equilibrium mixture containing gases. If the pressure is increased, the position of equilibrium moves in the direction of the fewest a collection of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. The fundamental unit of compounds Look again at the Haber process, which makes ammonia (NH On the left, there are 1 + 3 = 4 molecules of gas. On the right, there are two molecules of gas. If the pressure is increased, the position of equilibrium will move to the right and more ammonia will be made. If the pressure is reduced, the position of equilibrium will move to the left and less ammonia will be made. Look at the graph. You can see that for any given temperature the yield of ammonia increases as the pressure increases . You can also see that, for any given pressure, the yield goes down as the temperature increases . This is because the forward reaction is Heat energy is released in an exothermic reaction. We know this because the surroundings get warm. You will be expected to explain the choice of a high pressure for the Haber process. Look at the symbol equation for the reaction in the Haber process: There are 1 + 3 = 4 a collection of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. The fundamental unit of compounds of gas on the left of the equation, only two molecules of gas on the right. In an If the rate of the forward reaction and the rate of the back reaction in a reversible reaction are equal, the reaction is in equilibrium. involving gases, an increase in pressure favours the reaction which produces the smallest number of molecules. In this case, an increase in pressure favours the forward reaction, and more ammonia is produced. Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

There is a limit to the pressure that can be used industrially, because very high pressures require very strong and expensive equipment. This means a compromise pressure is chosen - high enough to get a good yield of ammonia, but not so high that it would add too much to the costs of the process. The pressure chosen is usually about 200 atmospheres - equivalent to about half the pressure of the water around the wreck of the RMS Titanic. "
231,4,"The coloured part of your eye, the iris, has a unique pattern. Visible light reflected off the iris can be analysed by a computer and compared to stored patterns. In this way, people can be identified by their iris pattern. All objects give off or emit infrared radiation. The hotter the object, the more infrared radiation it emits. Sensors that can detect this radiation allow the temperature of objects to be measured. This is useful for medical scans to detect abnormally hot parts of the body, which may indicate damage or illness. The detection of infrared emissions is also useful for tracking criminals at night and for military 'night vision' goggles. Materials absorb different types of electromagnetic radiation to different degrees. are weakly absorbed by skin and muscle, but strongly absorbed by dense material such as bone and metal. This means that X-rays can be used to produce images of bones inside your body, to check for damage such as fractures. X-rays are also used in industry to check metal components and welds for cracks or other damage. radiation is absorbed by water molecules, so it can be used for cooking. Water in the food absorbs the microwave radiation, which causes the water to heat up and cook the food. Microwaves are also used to monitor rain. Satellites have been set up to measure how much microwave radiation, sent from ground-based transmitters, is absorbed by water in the atmosphere. Computers analyse the information and build up a picture of the rain and cloud. light is used to detect forged bank notes. Certain chemicals in paper absorb ultraviolet light and emit the energy as blue light. Real bank notes have invisible markings that only show up using ultraviolet light.

233,4,"Decay is an essential life process, which helps to digest food and recycle materials. Bacteria and fungi are the main groups of decomposer. They release enzymes to break down compounds, so that they can absorb the nutrients. We can preserve our food, for example by freezing or canning, to remove the conditions needed for decay to occur. Food chains, pyramids of numbers and pyramids of biomass are all ways of showing how energy is passed on from one organism to another. Biomass is the food available for the next trophic level (feeding level) in a food chain. Biomass is used as a source of renewable energy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Intensive farming practices include growing high-yield crops, using fertilisers and pesticides and keeping animals indoors. Food production is increased but there are unwelcome side effects. Organic farming bans chemical inputs and has a less harmful effect on the environment but often produces less, more expensive food. Hydroponics is the production of food using nutrient-rich solution rather than soil. Leaves enable photosynthesis to happen. Photosynthesis is the process by which leaves absorb light and carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrate (food) for plants to grow. Leaves are adapted to perform their function eg they have a large surface area to absorb sunlight. Plants use minerals from the soil to build the complex molecules they need to survive and grow. Poor plant growth may be due to a deficiency of one or more minerals. Tests can be done to establish which mineral is deficient or a general purpose NPK fertiliser added. Plants have two different types of 'transport' tissue. Xylem transports water and solutes from the roots to the leaves, phloem transports food from the leaves to the rest of the plant. Transpiration is the process by which water evaporates from the leaves, which results in more water being drawn up from the roots. The element carbon is the present in all living organisms. It's recycled through various processes, which are described in the carbon cycle. Nitrogen is essential for the formation of amino acids to make proteins. The nitrogen cycle describes the ways in which nitrogen is recycled. Osmosis is the movement of water from a high water concentration to a low water concentration through a partially permeable membrane. Osmosis takes place in all living cells. Plants absorb water from the soil by osmosis through their root hair cells. Plants use water for several vital processes including photosynthesis and transporting minerals. All substances are made from atoms. Each atom is made of a nucleus - containing protons and neutrons - surrounded by electrons. The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom. The elements are arranged in the Periodic Table in ascending order of atomic number. The mass number of an atom is the total of protons plus neutrons. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons (and hence different mass numbers) are called isotopes of that element. A covalent bond is formed between non metal atoms, which combine together by sharing electrons. Covalent compounds have no free electrons and no ions so they don't conduct electricity. The Periodic Table is an arrangement of the elements in order of atomic number. Elements in the same vertical column are in the same group or family and have similar chemical properties. Electrolysis is the decomposition of a liquid using electricity. When ionic compounds are molten or dissolved in water the ions are free to move. When sulfuric acid is electrolysed, hydrogen is produced at the cathode (negative electrode) and oxygen at the anode (positive electrode). Aluminium is extracted from the mineral bauxite using the process of electrolysis. All matter is made of atoms. There are over a hundred different types of atom, called elements, and each one has a symbol. The atoms of a particular element are identical to each other. When atoms of different elements join together they make a compound. Compounds are represented by formulae that show how many atoms of each element are in the compound. Formulae can be worked out from the charge of the ions that make up the compound. Chemical reactions can be written down as balanced chemical equations. The Group 1 elements in the Periodic Table are known as the alkali metals. They include lithium, sodium and potassium, which all react vigorously with air and water. The reactivity of the alkali metals increases down the group. Flame tests are used to identify alkali metal ions in compounds. The Group 7 elements are also known as the halogens. They include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, which all have seven electrons in their outer shell. In a displacement reaction a less reactive element is Ionic bonding occurs between positive and negative ions, which attract each other and bind together to form ionic compounds. For example, sodium chloride consists of Na Each ion is surrounded by oppositely charged ions held in place by electrostatic attraction and forming an ionic crystal lattice. The ions in a crystal lattice are very strongly bonded - a high temperature is required to melt the crystal. The physical properties of different metals make them useful for different purposes. For example, aluminium conducts heat, which makes it a useful material for making saucepans and gold is shiny, which makes it an attractive material for jewellery. Metal particles are held together by strong metallic bonds, which is why they have high melting and boiling points. The loose electrons in metals can all move together through the metal – creating an electric current. The elements in the middle section of the Periodic Table are the transition elements. They're all metals with typical metallic properties eg conducting heat and electricity. They often form coloured compounds. Transition metal carbonates undergo thermal decomposition - a reaction in which a substance is broken down into at least two other substances by heat. Transition metal hydroxides are insoluble in water. They can be precipitated out of a transitional metal compound solution using sodium hydroxide solution. yourself on Growth in plants and humans "

238,4,"Pathogens are microorganisms - such as bacteria and viruses - that cause disease. Bacteria release toxins, and viruses damage our cells. White blood cells can ingest and destroy pathogens. They can produce antibodies to destroy pathogens, and antitoxins to neutralise toxins. In vaccination pathogens are introduced into the body in a weakened form. The process causes the body to produce enough white blood cells to protect itself against the pathogens, while not getting diseased. Antibiotics are effective against bacteria, but not against viruses. Some strains of bacteria are resistant to antibiotics. that cause infectious disease. Bacteria and viruses are the main pathogens. . They come in many shapes and sizes, but even the largest are only 10 micrometres long - 10 millionths of a metre. and, in favourable conditions, can multiply rapidly. Once inside the body, they release poisons or toxins that make us feel ill. Diseases caused by bacteria include: Hepatitis C virus. DNA are enclosed in a protein coat. Single-celled micro-organisms, some of which are pathogenic in humans, animals and plants. Singular is bacterium. . They are among the smallest organisms known and consist of a fragment of genetic material inside a protective protein coat. , and they damage the cell when they do this. A virus can get inside a cell and, once there, take over and make hundreds of thousands of copies of itself. Eventually the virus copies fill the whole host cell and burst it open. The viruses are then passed out in the bloodstream, the airways, or by other routes. The body has different ways of protecting itself against . This is aimed at stopping the pathogen getting into the body in the first place. The body’s passive immunity system includes the skin, Slimy white protein, which lines the respiratory tract and alimentary canal. Tiny hairs, which line the respiratory tract. They beat continuously to move mucus and dirt up the bronchi and trachea. in the respiratory system, acid in the stomach, and proteins which catalyse or speed up chemical reactions inside our bodies If a pathogen still manages to get into the body, the second defence takes over. This is called , and the white blood cells have key functions in this. A white blood cell ingesting disease-causing bacteria produce antitoxins that neutralise the toxins released by pathogens In a written examination, it is easy to get carried away and waffle on about things such as invaders and battles, but stick to the point. Note that: the pathogens are not the disease – they cause the disease white blood cells do not eat the pathogens – they ingest them antibodies and antitoxins are not living things – they are specialised proteins There are several different types of white blood cells, each with different functions, but they can be put into two main groups: Phagocytes can easily pass through blood vessel walls into the surrounding tissue and move towards a type of natural poison produced by an organism, often as a form of protection ingest and absorb the pathogens or toxins Having absorbed a pathogen, the phagocytes may also send out chemical messages that help nearby lymphocytes to identify the type of antibody needed to neutralise them. In order to see this content you need to have both Pathogens contain certain chemicals that are foreign to the body and are called antigens. Each lymphocyte carries a specific type of antibody - a protein that has a chemical 'fit' to a certain antigen. When a lymphocyte with the appropriate antibody meets the antigen, the lymphocyte reproduces quickly, and makes many copies of the antibody that neutralises the pathogen. In order to see this content you need to have both Antibodies neutralise pathogens in a number of ways: they bind to pathogens and damage or destroy them they coat pathogens, clumping them together so that they are easily ingested by phagocytes they bind to the pathogens and release chemical signals to attract more phagocytes Lymphocytes may also release antitoxins that stick to the appropriate toxin and stop it damaging the body. People can be immunised against a pathogen through vaccination. Different vaccines are needed for different Vaccination involves putting a small amount of an inactive form of a pathogen, or dead pathogen, into the body. Vaccines can contain: live pathogens treated to make them harmless a type of natural poison produced by an organism, often as a form of protection These all act as antigens. When injected into the body, they stimulate white blood cells to produce antibodies against the pathogen. Because the vaccine contains only a weakened or harmless version of a pathogen, the vaccinated person is not in danger of developing disease - although some people may suffer a mild reaction. If the person does get infected by the pathogen later, the required lymphocytes are able to reproduce rapidly and destroy it. In order to see this content you need to have both Vaccines in early childhood can give protection against many serious diseases. Sometimes more than one vaccine is given at a time, like the MMR triple vaccine against mumps, measles and rubella. Sometimes vaccine boosters are needed, because the immune response 'memory' weakens over time. Anti-tetanus injections may need to be repeated every ten years. Single-celled micro-organisms, some of which are pathogenic in humans, animals and plants. Singular is bacterium. or stop their growth. They do not work against ultramicroscopic non-cellular organisms that replicate themselves inside the cells of living hosts : it is difficult to develop drugs that kill viruses without also damaging the body’s tissues. A bacterium damaged and distorted by penicillin The first antibiotic - penicillin - was discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming. He noticed that some bacteria he had left in a petri dish had been killed by naturally occurring penicillium mould. Since the discovery of penicillin, many other antibiotics have been discovered or developed. Most antibiotics used in medicine have been altered chemically to make them more effective and safer for humans. Bacterial strains can develop resistance to antibiotics. This happens because of natural selection. In a large population of Single-celled micro-organisms, some of which are pathogenic in humans, animals and plants. Singular is bacterium. , there may be some cells that are not affected by the antibiotic. These cells survive and reproduce, producing even more bacteria that are not affected by the antibiotic. MRSA is methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. It is very dangerous because it is resistant to most antibiotics. It is important to avoid over-use of antibiotics, so we can slow down, or stop, the development of other strains of resistant bacteria. One simple way to reduce the risk of infection is to maintain personal hygiene and to keep hospitals clean. In the 19th century, Ignaz Semmelweis realised the importance of cleanliness in hospitals. However, although his ideas were successful, they were ignored at the time because people did not know that diseases were caused by pathogens that could be killed. "

During a recent sleep study, teachers noticed that kids had more difficulty learning when they stayed up an hour or two past their bedtime. ""Getting [to sleep] on time is as important as getting [to school] on time,"" says Gahan Fallone, who helped conduct the research. Scientists followed 74 students ages 6 to 12 from Rhode Island and Massachusetts for the three-week study. During that time, the researchers tracked the sleeping habits of students. Teachers, who weren’t told how long the kids slept or which week they stayed up late, rated the students’ performance in school. The teachers could tell when students didn’t get enough sleep. Students who slept eight hours or less a night were more forgetful, had more trouble paying attention, and had difficulty learning new lessons. How much sleep do kids need? Health experts from the National Sleep Foundation recommend that students ages 7 to 10 get at least 10 hours of sleep a night. Teachers and principals have long been aware that students who get enough sleep generally perform better in school, which leads to better grades. At Potter- Burns Elementary in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, school officials send notes home to parents asking them to make sure kids get enough shut-eye before the yearlyachievement tests.

244,4,"The nervous system allows the body to respond, through effectors, to changes in the environment detected by receptors. The process involves neurones, and is usually coordinated by the brain. A reflex action is an extra-rapid response to a stimulus, and this process also involves the nervous system, but it bypasses the brain. The iris of the eye is a receptor, which adjusts itself according to the amount of light entering the eye. Accommodation is the ability of the eye to bring objects into focus. The brain can be damaged by accidents or illness, such as strokes and Parkinson's disease. Receptors are groups of specialised cells. They can detect changes in the environment, which are called , and turn them into electrical impulses. Receptors are often located in the , such as the ear, eye and skin. Each organ has receptors sensitive to particular kinds of stimulus. The central nervous system (CNS) in humans consists of the brain and spinal cord. When a receptor is stimulated, it sends a signal along the nerve cells - neurones - to the brain. The brain then co-ordinates the response. An effector is any part of the body that produces the response. Here are some examples of effectors: a muscle contracting to move the arm a muscle squeezing saliva from the salivary gland chemical messengers produced in glands and carried by the blood to specific organs in the body Neurones are nerve cells. They carry information as tiny electrical signals. There are , each with a slightly different function. organs which recognize and respond to stimuli carry messages from one part of the Central Nervous System (brain and spinal cord). organs which have an effect when stimulated (eg muscles or glands) The diagram below shows a typical neurone - in this case, a motor neurone. It has tiny branches at each end and a long fibre carries the signals. Where two neurones meet, there is a tiny gap called a synapse. Signals cross this gap using chemicals. One neurone releases the chemical into the gap. The chemical diffuses across the gap and makes the next neurone transmit an electrical signal. In order to see this content you need to have both sends a signal to the central nervous system , where the brain co-ordinates the response. But sometimes , one that does not need the involvement of the brain. This response is known as a reflex action. Reflex actions are rapid and happen without us thinking.

Sensory neurone sends signal to relay neurone. The eye is a sense organ that responds to light. Light enters through the pupil, and is focused by the cornea and the lens onto the retina. The shape of the lens can be changed by the ciliary muscles so that the image always comes to a sharp focus at the retina. The eye needs to be able to control the amount of light entering it. In dim conditions, more light is allowed to enter so that a clear image can be formed on the retina. In bright conditions less light is allowed to enter so that the retina is not damaged. This adjustment is done by two sets of muscles in the iris: its circular muscles contract to close up the iris, making the pupil smaller - while its radial muscles contract to open up the iris, making the pupil larger. You can see how this reflex action works in the animation. In order to see this content you need to have both The ability of the lens to change its shape to focus near and distant objects is called accommodation.

When this happens, its functions can be impaired. For example, a bang on the head can cause concussion and blurred vision. A brain tumour happens when cells in the brain grow and divide uncontrollably or when cancer cells from cancer cells from other parts of the body, such as the lung or the breast, spread to the brain. The tumour damages the brain and causes it to press against the skull. This causes symptoms such as headaches, double vision, trembling and personality changes. A stroke happens when a part of the brain does not get enough oxygen and is damaged. This can happen if a blood vessel in the brain bursts or gets a blood clot. Unlike most other cells, brain cells cannot re-grow and permanent damage and even death can be caused. The symptoms depend on which part of the brain was damaged. They can include: loss of speech, memory or use of limbs - usually on one side of the body Parkinson's disease is caused by a reduced amount of dopamine, a chemical involved in transmitting nerve impulses from one neurone to another in the brain. It gradually gets worse and symptoms include: Epilepsy is caused by sudden bursts of unusual activity in the brain. This makes the brain stop working properly for a short time. It can cause the person to become unconscious and their body shakes repeatedly.

The 10-year-old from St. Rita's School in Hamden, Connecticut, recently traveled to Washington, D.C., as a In Washington, Dana spent a day with U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut. Dodd, a Democrat, was first elected to the Senate in 1980. Dana met the senator at 8:30 a.m. at the National Archives, where many of the country's most famous documents are kept. The senator showed Dana several of those documents, including the Constitution and the Emancipation Proclamation. During the next eight hours, Dana learned what a U.S. senator does. ""Senator Dodd is very busy,"" Dana said later. ""But he always had time for a smile and to explain to me what he was doing. I had lots of fun spending the day with him."" Here's what the reporter learned during her day with Senator Dodd. After visiting the National Archives, Dana and Senator Dodd go to the Russell Office Building, where most senators have their offices. While Dana waits for the senator to return from a meeting, she does some work at the senator's desk. Dana and Senator Dodd walk to a meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The committee is meeting to consider President George W. Bush's nomination of Richard Armitage as deputy secretary of state. Dana and the senator head to the Senate Chamber in the Capitol. The Capitol is located a short distance from the Russell Office Building. The two take a special subway that connects the office building to the Capitol. Usually, only government officials ride on the subway. Dodd and the other senators are meeting in the Senate Chamber to vote on a bill. It is the first of six votes the senators will cast throughout the day. Dana interviews students from the Greens Farms Academy in Westport, Connecticut. The students have traveled to Washington, D.C., to meet with Senator Dodd. The senator tells the students about some of the important issues facing the United States.

247,3,"Measures of average - The median If you place a set of numbers in order, the If there are two middle numbers, the median is the mean of those two numbers. Find the median of each of the following sets of numbers: a) 2, 4, 7, 1, 9, 3, 11 b) 4, 1, 3, 10, 6, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 11 The middle number is 4. Therefore the median is there are two middle numbers (4 and 6), so we find the mean of these two numbers. The median is therefore: If there are n numbers, the median will be the (n + 1) ÷ 2 = th number If there are 3 numbers, the median will be the (3 + 1) ÷ 2 = 2nd number. If there are 4 numbers, the median will be the (4 + 1) ÷ 2 = 2 Rachel records the number of goals scored by her five-a-side team in their first 20 matches.

250,2,"On December 6, two airplane passengers attracted a lot of attention at an airport in Washington, D.C. Each of the passengers had fluffy black-and-white fur and weighed more than 100 pounds. The passengers were two giant pandas--Mei Xiang and Tian Tian. Mei Xiang (MAY SHONG) is a 2-year-old female panda. Her name means ""beautiful fragrance."" Tian Tian (tee-YEN tee-YEN) is a 3-year-old male panda. His name means ""more and more."" The map shows China, the most populated country in the world. More than 1.2 billion people live within China's 3.7 million square miles. The two pandas arrived from China aboard a plane called . From the airport, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian were taken to the National Zoo, where they will live for the next ten years. Officials at the National Zoo agreed to give China $10 million in exchange for lending the United States the two pandas. That money will be used to protect pandas from becoming extinct in central China. About 1,000 pandas live in the mountain forests of central China, where they eat mainly bamboo shoots. The pandas need the forests to survive. The land where pandas are found, however, is being cleared and used for farmland. The trees are being used for firewood to heat people's homes. There are now seven pandas living in the United States. Two are in Washington, D.C.; two are in Atlanta, Georgia; and three are in San Diego, California. One of those seven pandas is a baby. The baby panda, Hua Mei, was born at the San Diego Zoo on August 21, 1999. Hua Mei is the first baby panda born in the Western Hemisphere since 1990. When he was born, he weighed less than 5 ounces and looked more like a rat than a panda. Fa Mingzhi is one of more than 4 million people who live near the area where the pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian come from. Most of the people who live in that area are farmers who need the forest to survive. Like many people, Fa Mingzhi wants to protect the animals. But, she says, people want to eat, too. ""It's good to protect the panda, but it's harder now on the people who live here,"" she said. As pandas and the people of China compete for the same resources, both face an uncertain future. measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.

255,4,"An atom of any given element consists of a nucleus containing a number of protons and neutrons. The nucleus is surrounded by electrons. The half-life of a radioactive isotope is the time taken for half its radioactive atoms to decay. There are three main types of radiation, called radiation, which all have different properties. Radiation can damage cells and make them cancerous. Very high doses of radiation can kill cells. It can be detected using photographic film or a Geiger-Muller tube. Radiation badges are used to monitor the level of radiation that people who work with radioactive sources are exposed to. Radiation has many practical uses. It can be used in medicine to trace where certain chemicals collect in the body, indicating disease, and also in industry, where it can be used to control measuring equipment. . The protons and neutrons are found in the nucleus at the centre of the atom, and the electrons are arranged in energy levels or shells around the nucleus. All the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons and electrons. However, the number of neutrons can vary. Atoms of the same element that have different numbers of neutrons are called of that element. The diagram shows three hydrogen isotopes. The different isotopes of an element have identical chemical properties. Some isotopes, however, are radioactive. This means that they give out radiation from their nuclei. This happens all the time, whatever is done to the substance. For example, the radiation is still given out if the substance is cooled down in a freezer, or takes part in a chemical reaction.

256,4,"As well its domestic uses, water is important for many industrial processes. It's taken from rivers, lakes, aquifers and reservoirs. Rainfall affects the amount of water available. Water can be polluted by fertilisers, pesticides and lead pipes. It's treated before entering the public supply. In addition to its familiar uses in the kitchen and bathroom, water is a vital resource for many important industrial chemical processes. . For example, in the manufacture of ammonia, nitric acid and many other important chemicals. . For example, when steel is manufactured large quantities of cooling water are used to stop furnaces from melting from the heat generated on the inside. . Many large scale chemical processes, like the manufacture of ammonium nitrate fertiliser, take place in solution in water. In the UK, water is taken from natural . An aquifer is an underground layer of permeable rock, gravel or sand which is soaked with water. In addition, artificial lakes called have been made by building a dam to accumulate and save river water in the valley behind. Demand for water rises all the time and towards the end of a long hot summer it's not unusual for there to be shortages in the UK. Conserving water also saves the materials and energy needed to treat and transport it. In the developing world millions of deaths each year are caused by waterborne diseases. Waste water from homes (sewage) carries large numbers of microbes which, if they find their way untreated into the water supply, can spread disease. In countries where rainfall is limited, the lack of adequate water supplies can be a major difficulty in irrigating crops, maintaining and developing industry and in supplying water to homes. Nitrate fertilisers are very soluble in water and are easily washed off fields by the rain and then into rivers and reservoirs. Because nitrates are all soluble they cannot easily be removed from the water. Older houses and water supply systems still rely on lead pipes. Poisonous lead compounds formed on the inside of the pipes slowly dissolve into the water. Pesticides used by farmers to kill weeds or insects may be washed or blown into streams and rivers. Raw water may contain dissolved salts and minerals, microbes, pollutants and insoluble materials like sand and stones. Water is treated to remove any harmful components before being fed into the public supply. This is achieved is several ways: - The water is sprayed onto specially prepared layers of sand and gravel. As it trickles through, different sized insoluble solids are removed. The filter beds are cleaned periodically by pumping clean water backwards through the filter. - A chemical is added which causes tiny solid particles (which would pass through a filter) to clump together into larger particles. These can then be allowed to settle out or may be filtered. - Chlorine gas, injected into the water, kills microbes. in the water are not removed by the treatment processes. For example, nitrate fertilisers applied to farm land in larger quantities than the plants can absorb may be washed by the rain into rivers and lakes. Nitrates can be poisonous particularly for young people or if they're in high concentrations so care has to be taken to limit nitrates getting into water sources. The large scale purification of sea water (desalination) uses large amounts of energy and needs specialised and expensive plant and equipment. The water produced would, therefore, be much more expensive than water from traditional sources. Particular ions present in solution in water can be detected by You can test to see if a solution contains sulfate ions by using barium sulfate. If barium chloride solution is added to a sample of water containing sulfate ions, barium sulfate is formed. Barium sulfate is insoluble in water, and will be seen as a white precipitate. Barium chloride solution + sodium sulfate solution → sodium chloride solution + solid barium sulfate The halogens are the elements in group 7 of the Periodic table, like chlorine, bromine and iodine. Their ions are called halide ions. You can test to see if a solution contains chloride, bromide or iodide ions by using silver nitrate. If silver nitrate solution is added to a sample of water containing halide ions the silver halide is precipitated. This is because the silver halides are all insoluble in water. Silver iodide is a pale yellow precipitate Silver nitrate solution + sodium bromide solution → sodium nitrate solution + solid silver bromide "

The orange-and-black-winged insects are in the middle of their yearly 2,500-mile trip from Mexico to Canada and the northern United States. Monarchs spend the summer flying in the fields. or travel to a new location, when the season changes. Each spring, tens of millions of monarchs from Mexico head north. In the fall, they will fly to Mexico for the winter months. Elizabeth Howard created the Web site Journey North. The site studies monarchs and tracks their travel patterns. ""They travel farther than any other migratory animal or insect on the planet,"" she says. ""What's most amazing is they go to the same place every winter [and spring], even though they've never been there before."" People who track monarchs are worried that the butterflies will become or at risk of dying out completely. Illegal logging in Mexico is thinning forests. The butterflies seek shelter in forest trees during the winter. Increasing temperatures are also threatening the butterflies' survival. ""There is a good chance that we will see big changes in the monarchs' migratory patterns in the next several decades,"" says monarch expert Karen Oberhauser. ""My hope is that monarchs will be able to adapt."" Some monarch butterflies live for just a few weeks. Others may live up to eight months. Each butterfly races to complete its leg of the journey and produce the next generation before it dies. Parent butterflies leave Mexico in March. Their children are born in the southern United States. Those butterflies travel north. Grandchildren butterflies are produced in the north, where they spend July. Finally, it is the great-grandchild of the first butterfly that returns to Mexico. It will remain there for the winter. Why might people want to save monarchs?

But we Which of the following triangles (P, Q or R) is a translation of triangle ABC? a translation of triangle ABC. Triangle ABC has been translated 3 squares to the right and 2 squares up. a translation of triangle ABC because the object and its image are facing in opposite directions. a translation of triangle ABC because the object and its image have different side lengths. They are different shapes. When we translate an object, every vertex (corner) must be moved in the same way. Triangle PQR has been translated 3 squares down and 4 squares to the right. All of the vertices have been translated in the same way, and the object and its image are exactly the same shape and size. has been translated 4 units to the right and 2 units upwards. We say that the displacement vector is A move downwards or to the left is indicated by a The object X has been translated by the vector (2, 11) after a translation. What vector describes this translation? To work out the horizontal movement after the translation, subtract the x-coordinates for p from p': To work out the vertical movement after the translation, subtract the y-coordinates for p from p': The vector that describes the translation is: If you are not sure, try drawing a sketch and marking the points has been translated 5 units upwards and -9 units to the left. Remember that any move to the left or downwards needs a When an object is transformed by a reflection the object and its image are always the same perpendicular distance from the mirror line. A and A' are the same perpendicular distance from the mirror line, as are B and B' and C and C'. in the mirror line to give the image (A'B'C'). P and P' are the same perpendicular distance from the mirror line, as are Q and Q', R and R' and S and S'. in the mirror line to give the image (P'Q'R'S'). Reflections in y = x, y = - x, y = c and x = c In your exam, you might have to reflect a shape in a given line. You will need to remember that: A point and its image are always the same perpendicular distance from the mirror line.

You may also be asked to rotate an object Remember that a point and its image are always the same distance from the centre of rotation. is the same distance from (0, -1) as is the same distance from (0, -1) as It is possible to use constructions to find the centre of rotation, but this can be time-consuming and complicated. Try to find the centre by observation, but remember that each point and its image be the same distance from the centre of rotation. When working out enlargements, you will need to know the tells us by how much the object has been enlarged. tells us where the enlargement is being measured from. Therefore, we say that the transformation is an You may be asked to enlarge a shape with a given . Look through this slideshow to see an example. To enlarge an object, scale factor 2. Draw lines from the centre of enlargement. The image points are A' B' C' OA' is twice as far as OA, because the scale factor is 2. To enlarge an object, scale factor 3. This method is identical to the previous one, but The centre of enlargement is not always outside the object. Look at the following examples: The next diagram shows an enlargement, scale factor 3. The centre of enlargement, X, is also a point of the object WXYZ. The result is that X' is in the same place as X. The next diagram shows an enlargement, scale factor 2, centre O, where O is inside the object. The result is that the image surrounds the object.

274,4,"Almost all molecules in living things contain carbon. Carbon moves in a way, passing from one organism to another in the biosphere, and between the other spheres of the environment (lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere). The is the key factor in maintaining the balance of carbon dioxide in the air. , taking carbon from the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide and making the carbohydrate glucose. , giving carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere; but they either plants (carbohydrates) or other animals (proteins and fats), which they then digest. They , giving off carbon dioxide into the air. Waste carbon-based material is excreted by animals, and then digested by - mainly microbes and fungi. The decomposers also respire, releasing carbon dioxide into the air. When animals die, their remains may be either eaten by scavengers (for example, crows) or digested by decomposers. Both scavengers and decomposers respire, giving off more carbon dioxide into the air. In certain conditions, both animal and plant remains may become fossilised, eventually forming carbon-based (coal, oil and gas). Both fossil fuels and plant material (wood) may later be , releasing still more carbon dioxide into the air. Therefore, all of the carbon taken out of the air by plants is later returned to the air. This is the . This slideshow should help you to understand how the cycle works: Oxygen is cycled in a similar way: Plants produce oxygen during the process of . This is released into the air. Plants also use some oxygen for respiration, but they produce Animals use oxygen from the air for the process of There is a balance between the excess oxygen given out by plants and the oxygen used by animals, so that the percentage of oxygen in dry air is Put down that pen and listen to some additional Science audio.

275,1,"What is a three-letter word for trouble? Flu! That is short for (in-floo-EN-zah). The flu is caused by a virus that can be passed easily from person to person. People who catch the virus often have fevers, sore muscles, and coughs. Doctors say the best way to keep from getting the virus is to get a flu shot. However, this year there weren't enough flu shots for everyone. Health experts found that one company's flu shots weren't safe. That company was supposed to supply the United States with half of the 100 million doses needed. This year, there were not enough flu shots for everyone. The people at highest risk received a flu shot first. Hang in there! The flu strikes the United States for only part of the year. Flu season usually runs from November to March. Despite the short supply of flu shots, there are ways to stay flu-free. To keep the virus away, practice healthful habits. Wash your hands often with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Germs can easily enter your body there. Don't share your drinks or eating utensils. All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation. "
276,0,"If you are like most kids, you've probably drawn a picture with crayons. Have you ever wondered how crayons are made? Crayon wax is melted in pots at the factory. Colored powder called Colorful hot liquid wax is poured into crayon-shaped holes called . The liquid wax fills up the molds. The crayon wax is left to cool. Then it is pushed out of the molds. Hard crayons come out! It takes about three to five minutes to make a crayon. Most 2- to 8-year-olds color for about a half hour every day. Experts say that the smell of a crayon is one of the easiest scents to recognize. The nickname for worn-down crayons is ""leftolas."" Most children in the United States will wear down 730 crayons by the time they are 10 years old! Workers check the hard crayons. Crayons that are not perfect are put aside to be melted in another batch. Perfect crayons are taken to a machine. It puts a label on each crayon. Finished crayons are sorted by color. The labeled crayons are placed into boxes, and the tops are closed. The colorful crayons are ready! What might happen next to a finished box of crayons? measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc. All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation. "
277,4,"The UK mains electricity supply is about 230V - and it can kill if it is not used safely. Electrical circuits, cables, plugs and appliances are designed to reduce the chances of receiving an electric shock. Power stations are built in order to generate electricity. The illustration shows the main steps involved. Water is turned into steam in the boilers The turbines spin the generators, which produce the electricity The electricity goes to the transformers to produce the correct voltage The energy needed to boil the water comes from fossil fuels or nuclear fuels. Renewable energy resources such as wind and wave power may drive the generators directly. A transformer is an electrical device that changes the voltage of an alternating current (AC) supply, such as the mains electrical supply. A transformer changes a high-voltage supply into a low-voltage one, or vice versa. a transformer that increases the voltage is called a transformer that decreases the voltage is called Electricity is transferred from power stations to consumers through the wires and cables of the National Grid. When a current flows through a wire some energy is lost as heat. The higher the current, the more heat is lost. To reduce these losses, the National Grid transmits electricity at a low current Power stations produce electricity at 25,000V. Electricity is sent through the National Grid cables at 400,000V, 275,000V and 132,000V. Step-up transformers are used at power stations to produce the very high voltages needed to transmit electricity through the National Grid power lines. These high voltages are too dangerous to use in the home, so step-down transformers are used locally to reduce the voltage to safe levels. The voltage of household electricity is about 230V. A correctly wired three-pin mains electricity plug is important for using electricity safely. A mains electricity cable contains two or three inner wires. Each wire has a core of copper because copper is a good conductor of electricity. The outer layers are flexible plastic because plastic is a good electrical a material which does not conduct electricity. Opposite of conductor . The inner wires are colour coded: the case is made from tough plastic or rubber because these materials are good electrical insulators the three pins are made from brass, which is a good conductor of electricity An electrical component that protects circuits and electrical devices from overload by melting when the current becomes too high. between the live terminal and the live pin the fuse breaks the circuit if too much current flows the cable is secured in the plug by a cable grip. This should grip the cable itself and not the individual wires inside it The diagram shows the key features of a correctly wired three-pin mains plug. There is an easy way to remember where to connect each wire. Take the second letters of the words blue, brown and striped. This reminds you that when you look into a plug from above: b You should know how the fuses or circuit breakers, which are used to protect electrical circuits and appliances, work. The fuse breaks the circuit if a fault in an appliance causes too much Moving electric charges, for example, electrons moving through a metal wire. flow. This protects the wiring and the appliance if something goes wrong. The fuse contains a piece of wire that melts easily. If the current going through the fuse is too great, the wire heats up until it melts and breaks the circuit. Fuses in plugs are made in standard ratings. The most common are 3A, 5A and 13A. The fuse should be rated at a slightly higher current than the device needs: if the device works at 3A, use a 5A fuse if the device works at 10A, use a 13A fuse A 13A fuse with a low melting point wire Cars also have fuses. An electrical fault in a car could start a fire, so all the circuits have to be protected by fuses. The circuit breaker does the same job as the fuse, but it works in a different way. A spring-loaded push switch is held in the closed position by a spring-loaded soft iron bolt. An A magnet made by wrapping a coil of wire around an iron bar and passing an electric current through the coil. is arranged so that it can pull the bolt away from the switch. If the current increases beyond a set limit, the electromagnet pulls the bolt towards itself, which releases the push switch into the open position. Check your understanding of the circuit breaker using this simulation. Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

Electrical appliances are earthed or double insulated for safety. Many electrical appliances, including cookers, washing machines and refrigerators, have metal cases. The earth wire creates a safe route for the current to flow through, if the live wire touches the casing. You will get an electric shock if the live wire inside an appliance, such as a cooker, comes loose and touches the metal casing. However, the earth terminal is connected to the metal casing, so the current goes through the earth wire instead of causing an electric shock. A strong current surges through the earth wire because it has a very low resistance. This breaks the fuse and disconnects the appliance. Some appliances, such as vacuum cleaners and electric drills, do not have an earth wire. This is because they have plastic casings, or they have been designed so that the live wire can not touch the casing. As a result, the casing cannot give an electric shock, even if the wires inside become loose. These appliances have double insulation and carry a symbol. "
278,2,"This greeting wishes others good fortune and happiness in the Chinese New Year. People kick off the holiday on February 18 this year. The Chinese calendar is split up into months based on the or moon, cycle. The Chinese New Year begins on the first new moon falling between January 21 and February 20. It ends on the full moon 15 days later, when the moon is brightest. People in Chinese communities around the world celebrate the holiday with music, dancing, fireworks, feasts, and parades. At celebrations, people wear red clothes and give children red envelopes with money for good luck. Red is considered a color that wards off bad luck. The Chinese New Year ends with the Lantern Festival. On that night, children carry lanterns in a parade under the light of the full moon. The highlight of the Lantern Festival parade is the traditional dragon dance, when dancers guide a long, colorful dragon made of silk, paper, and bamboo through the streets. Each year in the Chinese calendar is named after one of 12 animals. Legend has it that people born in each animal's year inherit some of that animal's qualities. This year is the Year of the Pig. People born in pig years are considered honest, kind, and well informed. measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc. All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation. "

280,4,"The practical Egyptians seem to have been able to perform some surgical operations - and they have left enough information behind them to tell us a little about it. . They could reset dislocated joints, and they could mend broken bones. As long as the problem was on the surface of the skin, Egyptian surgery could deal with it quite effectively. Egyptian doctors were - we know that they bound willow leaves into the bandages of patients with inflamed wounds (willow has antiseptic properties). They could also stitch wounds. Archaeologists have found stone carvings in Egypt showing , and there are Egyptian papyri which speak of cautery and surgery. Egyptian surgery, however, did Bronze surgical knives, from Egypt and Mesopotamia, c.600-200BC. Knives like these may have been used during mummification Knives like these may have been used during mummification. Egyptians doctors did not have anaesthetics, and had only herbal antiseptics - so successful surgical operations would have been extremely difficult for them to perform. Source A: Instructions for treating a broken nose If you examine a man whose nose is disfigured - part of it being squashed in while the other part is swollen and both his nostrils are bleeding, then you shall say: ""You have a broken nose and this is an ailment I can treat."" You should clean his nose with two plugs of linen and then insert two plugs soaked in grease into his nostrils. You should make him rest until the swelling has gone down. You should bandage his nose with stiff rolls of linen and treat him with lint every day until he recovers. Source B: Instructions for treating swellings in the body When you come across a swelling of the flesh in any part of the body of a patient and your patient is clammy and the swelling comes and goes under the finger, then you must say to your patient: ""It is a tumour of the flesh. I will treat the disease. I will try to heal it with fire since cautery heals."" When you come across a swelling that has attacked a channel, then it has formed a tumour in the body. If when you examine it with your fingers, it is like a hard stone, then you should say: ""It is a tumour of the channels. I shall treat the disease with a knife.""
